josiah was an ancestor of jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to babylon 
after the deportation to babylon jechoniah was the father of shealtiel shealtiel was an ancestor of zerubbabel
zerubbabel was the father of abiud abiud the father of eliakim and eliakim the father of azor
azor was the father of zadok zadok the father of achim and achim the father of eliud 
eliud was the father of eleazar eleazar the father of matthan and matthan the father of jacob
jacob was the father of joseph the husband of mary by whom jesus was born who is called christ
all the generations from abraham to david were fourteen generations from david to the deportation to babylon fourteen generations and from the deportation to babylon to the christ fourteen generations 
the birth of jesus christ happened in the following way his mother mary was engaged to marry joseph but before they came together she was found to be pregnant by the holy spirit
but joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to publicly disgrace her so he intended to divorce her quietly 
as he thought about these things an angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream saying joseph son of david do not fear to take mary as your wife because the one who is conceived in her is conceived by the holy spirit
she will bear a son and you will call his name jesus for he will save his people from their sins 
now all this happened to fulfill what was spoken by the lord through the prophet saying
behold the virgin will become pregnant and will bear a son and they will call his name immanuelwhich being translated is god with us 
joseph got up from his sleep and did as the angel of the lord commanded him and he took her as his wife
but he did not know her until she gave birth to a son then he called his name jesus  
after jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king learned men from the east arrived in jerusalem saying
where is he who was born king of the jews we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him
when herod the king heard this he was troubled and all jerusalem with him 
herod brought together all the chief priests and scribes of the people and he asked them where is the christ to be born
they said to him in bethlehem of judea for this is what was written by the prophet
but you bethlehem in the land of judah  are not the least among the rulers of judah for from you will come one who rules  who will shepherd my people israel 
then herod secretly called the learned men to ask them exactly what time the star had appeared
he sent them to bethlehem saying go and search carefully for the young child when you have found him bring me a report so that i also may come and worship him 
after they had heard the king they went on their way and the star that they had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood still over where the young child was
when they saw the star they rejoiced with very great joy 
they went into the house and saw the young child with mary his mother they fell down and worshiped him they opened their treasures and offered him gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh
god warned them in a dream not to return to herod so they departed to their own country by another way 
after they had departed an angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream and said get up take the young child and his mother and flee to egypt remain there until i tell you for herod will seek the young child to destroy him
that night joseph rose and took the young child and his mother and departed into egypt
he remained there until the death of herod this fulfilled what had been spoken by the lord through the prophet saying out of egypt i have called my son 
then herod when he saw that he had been mocked by the learned men was very angry he sent and killed all the male children that were in bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old and under according to the time that he had determined exactly from the learned men 
then was fulfilled what had been spoken through jeremiah the prophet saying
a voice was heard in ramah  weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children  and she refused to be comforted  because they were no more 
when herod died behold an angel of the lord appeared in a dream to joseph in egypt and said
get up and take the child and his mother and go to the land of israel for those who sought the childs life are dead
joseph rose took the child and his mother and came into the land of israel 
but when he heard that archelaus was reigning over judea in the place of his father herod he was afraid to go there after god warned him in a dream he left for the region of galilee
and went and lived in a city called nazareth this fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophets that he would be called a nazarene  
in those days john the baptist came preaching in the wilderness of judea saying
repent for the kingdom of heaven is near
for this is he who was spoken of by isaiah the prophet saying the voice of one calling out in the wilderness make ready the way of the lord  make his paths straight 
now john wore clothing of camels hair and a leather belt around his waist his food was locusts and wild honey
then jerusalem all judea and all the region around the jordan river went out to him
they were baptized by him in the jordan river confessing their sins 
but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees coming to him for baptism he said to them you offspring of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming
bear fruit worthy of repentance
do not think of saying among yourselves we have abraham for our father for i say to you that god is able to raise up children for abraham even out of these stones 
already the ax has been placed against the root of the trees so every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire
i baptize you with water for repentance but he who comes after me is mightier than i and i am not worthy even to carry his sandals he will baptize you with the holy spirit and with fire
his winnowing fork is in his hand to thoroughly clear off his threshing floor and to gather his wheat into the storehouse but he will burn up the chaff with fire that can never be put out 
then jesus came from galilee to the jordan river to be baptized by john
but john kept trying to stop him saying i need to be baptized by you and do you come to me
jesus responded and said to him permit it now for it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness then john permitted him 
after he was baptized jesus came up immediately from the water and behold the heavens were opened to him he saw the spirit of god coming down like a dove and resting upon him
behold a voice came out of the heavens saying this is my beloved son i am very pleased with him  
then jesus was led up by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil
when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was hungry
the tempter came and said to him if you are the son of god command these stones to become bread
but jesus answered and said to him it is written man does not live on bread alone but by every word that comes out of the mouth of god 
then the devil took him into the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple building
and said to him if you are the son of god throw yourself down for it is written he will command his angels to take care of you and they will carry you in their hands  so that you will not hit your foot against a stone 
jesus said to him again it is written you must not test the lord your god
again the devil took him up to a very high hill and showed him all the kingdoms of the world along with all their glory
he said to him all these things i will give you if you fall down and worship me 
then jesus said to him go away from here satan for it is written you will worship the lord your god and you will serve only him
then the devil left him and behold angels came and served him 
now when jesus heard that john had been handed over he withdrew into galilee
he left nazareth and went and lived in capernaum which is by the sea of galilee in the territories of zebulun and naphtali 
this happened to fulfill what was said by isaiah the prophet
the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali  toward the sea beyond the jordan  galilee of the gentiles
the people who sat in darkness  have seen a great light and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death  upon them has a light arisen 
from that time jesus began to preach and say repent for the kingdom of heaven is near 
as he was walking by the sea of galilee he saw two brothers simon who is called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishermen
jesus said to them come follow me and i will make you fishers of men
immediately they left the nets and followed him 
as jesus was going on from there he saw two other brothers james son of zebedee and john his brother they were in the boat with zebedee their father mending their nets he called them
and they immediately left the boat and their father and followed him 
jesus went about in all of galilee teaching in their synagogues preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every kind of disease and sickness among the people
the news about him went out into all of syria and the people brought to him all those who suffered from various diseases and pains those who were possessed by demons the epileptics and the paralytics jesus healed them
large crowds followed him from galilee the decapolis jerusalem and judea and from beyond the jordan  
when jesus saw the crowds he went up on the mountain when he had sat down his disciples came to him
he opened his mouth and taught them saying
blessed are the poor in spirit  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are those who mourn  for they will be comforted 
blessed are the meek  for they will inherit the earth
blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness  for they will be filled
blessed are the merciful  for they will obtain mercy
blessed are the pure in heart  for they will see god 
blessed are the peacemakers  for they will be called sons of god
blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness sake  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven 
blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you falsely for my sake
rejoice and be glad for great is your reward in heaven for in this way people persecuted the prophets who lived before you 
you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its taste how can it be made salty again it is never again good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under peoples feet
you are the light of the world a city set on a hill cannot be hidden 
neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket but rather on the lampstand and it shines for everyone in the house
let your light shine before people in such a way that they see your good deeds and glorify your father who is in heaven 
do not think that i have come to destroy the law or the prophets i have come not to destroy them but to fulfill them
for truly i say to you that until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter will in any way pass away from the law until all things have been accomplished 
therefore whoever breaks the least one of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever keeps them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven
for i say to you that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees you will in no way enter the kingdom of heaven 
you have heard that it was said to them in ancient times do not murder and whoever murders will be subject to judgment
but i say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment and whoever says to his brother you worthless person will be subject to the council and whoever says you fool will be subject to the fire of hell 
therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you
leave your gift there in front of the altar and go on your way first be reconciled with your brother and then come and offer your gift 
agree with your adversary quickly while you are with him on the way to court or your adversary may hand you over to the judge and the judge may hand you over to the officer and you may be thrown into prison
truly i say to you you will never come out from there until you have paid the last penny you owe 
you have heard that it was said do not commit adultery
but i say to you that everyone who looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart 
if your right eye causes you to stumble pluck it out and throw it away from you for it is better for you that one of your members should perish than that your whole body should be thrown into hell
if your right hand causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away from you for it is better for you that one of your members should perish than that your whole body should go into hell 
it was also said whoever sends his wife away let him give her a certificate of divorce
but i say to you that everyone who divorces his wife except on account of sexual immorality makes her an adulteress whoever marries her after she has been divorced commits adultery 
again you have heard that it was said to those in ancient times do not swear a false oath but carry out your oaths to the lord
but i say to you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is the throne of god
nor by the earth for it is the footstool for his feet nor by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king 
neither swear by your head for you cannot make one hair white or black
but let your speech be yes yes or no no anything that is more than this is from the evil one 
you have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
but i say to you do not resist one who is evil instead whoever strikes you on your right cheek turn to him the other also 
if anyone wishes to bring a lawsuit against you and takes away your tunic let that person also have your cloak
whoever compels you to go one mile go with him two
give to anyone who asks you and do not turn away from anyone who wishes to borrow from you 
you have heard that it was said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy
but i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you  the best ancient copies do not have bless those who curse you do good to those who hate you 
so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust 
for if you love those who love you what reward do you get do not even the tax collectors do the same thing
if you greet only your brothers what do you do more than others do not even the gentiles do the same thing
therefore you must be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect  
watch out that you do not do your acts of righteousness before people to be seen by them or else you will have no reward from your father who is in heaven
so when you give alms do not sound a trumpet before yourself as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may be glorified by people truly i say to you they have received their reward in full 
but when you give alms do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
so that your alms may be given in secret then your father who sees in secret will reward you 
when you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they may be seen by people truly i say to you they have received their reward
but you when you pray enter your inner chamber shut the door and pray to your father who is in secret then your father who sees in secret will reward you
when you pray do not make useless repetitions as the pagans do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words 
therefore do not be like them for your father knows what things you need before you ask him
therefore pray like this our father in heaven  may your name be honored as holy
may your kingdom come may your will be done  on earth as it is in heaven 
give us today our daily bread
forgive us our debts  as we also have forgiven our debtors
do not bring us into temptation  but deliver us from the evil one  the best ancient copies do not have for yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen  
for if you forgive people their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you
but if you do not forgive their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses 
when you fast do not have a sad face as the hypocrites do for they disfigure their faces so that they may appear to people to be fasting truly i say to you they have received their reward in full
but you when you fast anoint your head and wash your face
so that you may not appear to people to be fasting but only to your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you 
do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal
instead store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal
for where your treasure is there will your heart be also 
the eye is the lamp of the body therefore if your eye is good your whole body is filled with light
but if your eye is bad your whole body is full of darkness therefore if the light that is in you is actually darkness how great is that darkness
no one can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other you cannot serve god and wealth 
therefore i say to you do not worry about your life what you will eat or what you will drink or about your body what you will wear for is not life more than food and the body more than clothes
look at the birds in the sky they do not sow or reap or gather into barns but your heavenly father feeds them are you not more valuable than they are 
which one of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his lifespan
why are you anxious about clothing think about the lilies in the fields how they grow they do not labor and they do not spin cloth
yet i say to you even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these 
if god so clothes the grass in the fields which exists today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven how much more will he clothe you you of little faith
therefore do not be anxious and say what will we eat or what will we drink or what clothes will we wear 
for the gentiles search for these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them
but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you
therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow for tomorrow will be anxious for itself each day has enough evil of its own  
do not judge and you will not be judged
for with the judgment you judge you will be judged and with the measure that you measure it will be measured out to you 
why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brothers eye but you do not take notice of the log that is in your own eye
how can you say to your brother let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye while the log is in your own eye
you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take out the piece of straw that is in your brothers eye 
do not give what is holy to the dogs and do not throw your pearls in front of the pigs otherwise they may trample them underfoot and then turn and tear you to pieces 
ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and it will be opened to you
for everyone who asks receives everyone who seeks finds and to the person who knocks it will be opened
or which one of you if his son asks for a loaf of bread will give him a stone
or if he asks for a fish will give him a snake 
therefore if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good things to those who ask him
therefore whatever things you want people to do to you you should also do to them for this is the law and the prophets 
enter through the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and there are many people who go through it
but the gate is narrow and the way is difficult that leads to life and there are few who find it 
beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but are truly ravenous wolves
by their fruits you will know them do people gather grapes from a thornbush or figs from thistles
in the same way every good tree produces good fruit but the bad tree produces bad fruit 
a good tree cannot produce bad fruit nor can a bad tree produce good fruit
every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire
so then you will recognize them by their fruits 
not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter into the kingdom of heaven but only those who do the will of my father who is in heaven
many people will say to me in that day lord lord did we not prophesy in your name in your name drive out demons and in your name do many miracles
then will i openly declare to them i never knew you get away from me you who practice lawlessness 
therefore everyone who hears my words and obeys them will be like a wise man who built his house upon a rock
the rain came down the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house but it did not fall down for it was founded on the rock 
but everyone who hears my words and does not obey them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand
the rain came down the floods came and the winds blew and struck that house and it fell and its destruction was complete 
it came about that when jesus finished speaking these words the crowds were astonished by his teaching
for he taught them as one who had authority and not as their scribes  
when jesus had come down from the hill large crowds followed him
behold a leper came to him and bowed before him saying lord if you are willing you can make me clean
jesus reached out his hand and touched him saying i am willing be clean immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy 
jesus said to him see that you say nothing to any man go on your way show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that moses commanded for a testimony to them 
when he was coming into capernaum a centurion came to him begging him
and saying lord my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible agony
then jesus said to him i will come and heal him 
the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that you should enter under my roof only say the word and my servant will be healed
for i also am a man under authority and i have soldiers under me i say to this one go and he goes and to another one come and he comes and to my servant do this and he does it
when jesus heard this he was amazed and said to those who were following him truly i say to you i have not found anyone with such faith in israel 
i tell you many will come from the east and the west and they will recline at the table with abraham isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven
but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth
jesus said to the centurion go as you have believed so may it be done for you and the servant was healed at that very hour 
when jesus had come into peters house he saw peters motherinlaw lying sick with a fever
jesus touched her hand and the fever left her then she got up and started serving him 
when evening had come the people brought to jesus many who were possessed by demons he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick
this was to fulfill what was spoken through isaiah the prophet saying he took our illnesses  and bore our diseases 
now when jesus saw the crowd around him he gave instructions to leave for the other side of the sea of galilee
then a scribe came to him and said teacher i will follow you wherever you go
jesus said to him foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head 
another of the disciples said to him lord allow me first to go and bury my father
but jesus said to him follow me and leave the dead to bury their own dead 
when jesus had entered a boat his disciples followed him into it
behold there arose a great storm on the sea so that the boat was covered with the waves but jesus was asleep
the disciples came to him and woke him up saying save us lord we are perishing 
jesus said to them why are you afraid you of little faith then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea then there was a great calm
the men marveled and said what sort of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him 
when jesus had come to the other side and to the country of the gadarenes two men who were possessed by demons met him they were coming out of the tombs and were very violent so that no traveler could pass that way
behold they cried out and said what do we have to do with you son of god have you come here to torment us before the set time 
now a herd of many pigs was there feeding not too far away from them
the demons kept pleading with jesus and saying if you cast us out send us away into that herd of pigs
jesus said to them go the demons came out and went into the pigs and behold the whole herd rushed down the steep hill into the sea and they died in the water 
those who had been tending the pigs ran away and they went into the city and reported everything especially what had happened to the men who had been possessed by demons
behold all the city came out to meet jesus when they saw him they begged him to leave their region  
jesus entered a boat crossed over and came into his own city
behold they brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a mat seeing their faith jesus said to the paralyzed man son be encouraged your sins have been forgiven 
behold some of the scribes said among themselves this man is blaspheming
jesus knew their thoughts and said why are you thinking evil in your hearts
for which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or to say get up and walk
but that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins   he said to the paralytic get up pick up your mat and go to your house 
then the man got up and went away to his house
when the crowds saw this they were afraid and glorified god who had given such authority to people
as jesus passed by from there he saw a man named matthew sitting at the tax collectors tent he said to him follow me he got up and followed him 
as jesus sat down to eat in the house behold many tax collectors and sinners came and dined with jesus and his disciples
when the pharisees saw it they said to his disciples why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners 
when jesus heard this he said people who are strong in body do not need a physician only those who are sick do
you should go and learn what this means i desire mercy and not sacrifice for i came not to call the righteous to repent but sinners 
then the disciples of john came to him and said why do we and the pharisees often fast but your disciples do not fast
jesus said to them can the sons of the wedding hall mourn while the bridegroom is still with them but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then they will fast 
no man puts a piece of new cloth on an old garment for the patch will tear away from the garment and a worse tear will be made 
neither do people put new wine into old wineskins if they do the skins will burst the wine will be spilled and the wineskins will be destroyed instead they put new wine into fresh wineskins and both will be preserved 
while jesus was saying these things to them behold an official came and bowed down to him he said my daughter has just now died but come and lay your hand on her and she will live
then jesus got up and followed him and so did his disciples 
behold a woman who suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind jesus and touched the edge of his garment
for she had said to herself if only i touch his clothes i will be made well
but jesus turned and saw her and said daughter take courage your faith has made you well and the woman was healed from that hour 
when jesus came into the officials house he saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion
he said go away for the girl is not dead but she is asleep but they laughed at him in mockery 
when the crowd had been put outside he entered the room and took her by the hand and the girl got up
the news about this spread into all that region 
as jesus passed by from there two blind men followed him they kept shouting and saying have mercy on us son of david
when jesus had come into the house the blind men came to him jesus said to them do you believe that i can do this they said to him yes lord 
then jesus touched their eyes and said let it be done to you according to your faith
and their eyes were opened then jesus strictly commanded them and said see that no one knows about this
but the two men went out and spread the news about this throughout that region 
as those two men were going away behold a mute man possessed by a demon was brought to jesus
when the demon had been driven out the mute man spoke the crowds were astonished and said this has never been seen before in israel
but the pharisees were saying by the ruler of the demons he drives out demons 
jesus went about all the cities and the villages he continued teaching in their synagogues preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness
when he saw the crowds he had compassion for them because they were troubled and discouraged they were like sheep without a shepherd 
he said to his disciples the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few
therefore urgently pray to the lord of the harvest so that he may send out laborers into his harvest  
jesus called his twelve disciples together and gave them authority over unclean spirits to drive them out and to heal all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness 
now the names of the twelve apostles were these the first simon whom he also called peter and andrew his brother james son of zebedee and john his brother
philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the tax collector james son of alphaeus and thaddaeus
simon the zealot and judas iscariot who would betray him 
these twelve jesus sent out he instructed them and said do not go to any place where gentiles live and do not enter any town of the samaritans
go instead to the lost sheep of the house of israel
and as you go preach and say the kingdom of heaven is near 
heal the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers and cast out demons freely you have received freely give
do not carry any gold silver or copper in your belts
do not take a traveling bag for your journey or an extra tunic or sandals or a staff for a laborer deserves his food 
whatever city or village you enter find who is worthy in it and stay there until you leave
as you enter into the house greet it
if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it but if it is not worthy let your peace return to you 
as for those who do not receive you or listen to your words when you depart from that house or city shake off the dust from your feet
truly i say to you it will be more bearable for the land of sodom and gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city 
see i send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves so be as wise as serpents and innocent as doves
watch out for people they will deliver you up to councils and they will whip you in their synagogues
then you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake as a testimony to them and to the gentiles 
when they deliver you up do not be anxious about how or what you will speak for what to say will be given to you at that time
for it is not you who will speak but the spirit of your father who will speak in you 
brother will deliver up brother to death and a father his child children will rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death
you will be hated by everyone because of my name but whoever endures to the end that person will be saved
when they persecute you in this city flee to the next for truly i say to you you will not have gone through the cities of israel before the son of man has come 
a disciple is not greater than his teacher nor a servant above his master
it is enough for the disciple that he should be like his teacher and the servant like his master if they have called the master of the house beelzebul how much worse will be the names they call the members of his household 
therefore do not fear them for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed and nothing hidden that will not be known
what i tell you in the darkness say in the daylight and what you hear softly in your ear proclaim upon the housetops 
do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul instead fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell
are not two sparrows sold for a small coin yet not one of them falls to the ground without your fathers knowledge
but even the hairs of your head are all numbered
do not fear you are more valuable than many sparrows 
therefore everyone who confesses me before men i will also confess before my father who is in heaven
but he who denies me before men i will also deny before my father who is in heaven 
do not think that i came to bring peace upon the earth i did not come to bring peace but a sword
for i came to set a man against his father  and a daughter against her mother and a daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw
a mans enemies will be those of his own household 
he who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
he who does not pick up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me
he who finds his life will lose it but he who loses his life for my sake will find it 
he who welcomes you welcomes me and he who welcomes me also welcomes him who sent me
he who welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophets reward and he who welcomes a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous mans reward 
whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple truly i say to you he will in no way lose his reward  
it came about that when jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities
now when john heard in the prison about the deeds of the christ he sent a message by his disciples
and said to him are you the one who is coming or should we look for another 
jesus answered and said to them go and report to john what you see and hear
the blind are receiving sight the lame are walking lepers are being cleansed the deaf are hearing again the dead are being raised back to life and the gospel is being preached to the poor
blessed is anyone who does not stumble because of me 
as these men went on their way jesus began to say to the crowds about john what did you go out in the desert to seea reed being shaken by the wind
but what did you go out to seea man dressed in soft clothing really those who wear soft clothing live in kings houses 
but what did you go out to seea prophet yes i say to you and much more than a prophet
this is he of whom it was written see i am sending my messenger before your face  who will prepare your way before you 
truly i say to you that among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than john the baptist yet the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is
from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and men of violence take it by force 
for all the prophets and the law have been prophesying until john
and if you are willing to accept it he is elijah who was to come
he who has ears to hear let him hear 
to what should i compare this generation it is like children sitting in the marketplaces calling out to the others
saying we played a flute for you  and you did not dance we mourned  and you did not weep 
for john came not eating bread or drinking wine and they say he has a demon
the son of man came eating and drinking and they say look he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners but wisdom is justified by her deeds 
then jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles were done because they had not repented
woe to you chorazin woe to you bethsaida if the miracles had been done in tyre and sidon which were done in you they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes
but i tell you it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the day of judgment than for you 
you capernaum do you think you will be exalted to heaven no you will be brought down to hades for if in sodom there had been done the miracles that were done in you it would still have remained until today
but i say to you that it will be easier for the land of sodom in the day of judgment than for you 
at that time jesus said i praise you father lord of heaven and earth because you concealed these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children
yes father for this was pleasing in your sight
all things have been entrusted to me from my father and no one knows the son except the father and no one knows the father except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him 
come to me all you who labor and are heavy burdened and i will give you rest
take my yoke on you and learn from me for i am meek and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls
for my yoke is easy and my burden is light  
at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields his disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat them
but when the pharisees saw that they said to jesus see your disciples do what is unlawful to do on the sabbath 
but jesus said to them have you never read what david did when he was hungry and the men who were with him
he went into the house of god and ate the bread of the presence which was unlawful for him to eat and unlawful for those who were with him but lawful only for the priests 
have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple profane the sabbath but are guiltless
but i say to you that one greater than the temple is here 
if you had known what this meant i desire mercy and not sacrifice you would not have condemned the guiltless
for the son of man is lord of the sabbath 
then jesus left from there and went into their synagogue
behold there was a man who had a withered hand the pharisees asked jesus saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath so that they might accuse him of sinning 
jesus said to them what man would there be among you who if he had just one sheep and if this sheep fell into a pit on the sabbath would not take hold of it and raise it out
how much more valuable then is a man than a sheep therefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath 
then jesus said to the man stretch out your hand he stretched it out and it was restored to health just like the other hand
but the pharisees went out and plotted against him they were seeking how they might destroy him 
jesus knowing this withdrew from there many people followed him and he healed them all
he commanded them not to make him known to others
that it might be fulfilled what had been said through isaiah the prophet saying 
see my servant whom i have chosen  my beloved one in whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit upon him  and he will proclaim justice to the gentiles 
he will not strive nor cry aloud  neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets
he will not break any bruised reed  he will not quench any smoking flax  until he leads justice to victory
and in his name the gentiles will have hope 
then someone blind and mute possessed by a demon was brought to jesus he healed him with the result that the mute man spoke and saw
all the crowds were amazed and said can this man be the son of david 
but when the pharisees heard of this miracle they said this man does not cast out demons except by beelzebul the prince of the demons
but jesus knew their thoughts and said to them every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate and every city or house divided against itself will not stand 
if satan drives out satan he is divided against himself how then will his kingdom stand
and if i drive out demons by beelzebul by whom do your sons drive them out for this reason they will be your judges 
but if i drive out demons by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god has come upon you
how can anyone enter the house of the strong man and take away his belongings without tying up the strong man first then he will steal his belongings from his house
the one who is not with me is against me and the one who does not gather with me scatters 
therefore i say to you every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven
whoever speaks any word against the son of man that will be forgiven him but whoever speaks against the holy spirit that will not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in that which is to come 
make a tree good and its fruit good or make the tree bad and its fruit bad for a tree is recognized by its fruit
you offspring of vipers since you are evil how can you say good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
the good man from the good treasure of his heart produces what is good and the evil man from the evil treasure of his heart produces what is evil 
i say to you that in the day of judgment people will give an account for every idle word they will have said
for by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned 
then certain scribes and pharisees answered jesus and said teacher we wish to see a sign from you
but jesus answered and said to them an evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah the prophet
for as jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the big fish so will the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth 
the men of nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation of people and will condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonah and see someone greater than jonah is here 
the queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and see someone greater than solomon is here 
when an unclean spirit has gone away from a man it passes through waterless places and looks for rest but does not find it
then it says i will return to my house from which i came having returned it finds the house emptyit had been swept clean and put in order
then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more evil than itself and they all come in to live there then the final condition of that man becomes worse than the first it will be just like that with this evil generation 
while jesus was still speaking to the crowds behold his mother and his brothers stood outside seeking to speak to him
someone said to him look your mother and your brothers stand outside seeking to speak to you 
but jesus answered and said to him who told him who is my mother and who are my brothers
then he stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said see here are my mother and my brothers
for whoever does the will of my father who is in heaven that person is my brother and sister and mother  
on that day jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea
a very large crowd gathered around him so he got into a boat and sat in it while the whole crowd stood on the beach 
then jesus said many things to them in parables he said behold a farmer went out to sow seed
as he sowed some seeds fell beside the road and the birds came and devoured them
other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil immediately they sprang up because the soil had no depth
but when the sun had risen they were scorched because they had no root and they withered away 
other seeds fell among the thorn plants the thorn plants grew up and choked them
other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop some one hundred times as much some sixty and some thirty
he who has ears let him hear 
the disciples came and said to jesus why do you talk to the crowd in parables
jesus answered and said to them you have been given the privilege of understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given
for whoever has will be given more and he will have an abundance but whoever does not have even what he has will be taken away from him 
this is why i talk to them in parables though they are seeing  they do not see and though they are hearing  they do not hear or understand
to them the prophecy of isaiah is fulfilled that which says listening you will hear but you will never understand  seeing you will see but you will never know 
for the heart of this people has become dull  and with their ears they hardly hear  and they have shut their eyes otherwise they might see with their eyes  and hear with their ears  and understand with their heart and turn again and i would heal them 
but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear
truly i say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things that you see and did not see them they desired to hear the things that you hear and did not hear them 
listen then to the parable of the farmer who sowed his seed
when anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart this is the seed that was sown beside the road 
what was sown on rocky ground is the person who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy
yet he has no root in himself and he endures for a while when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word he quickly falls away 
what was sown among the thorn plants this is the person who hears the word but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becomes unfruitful
the seed that was sown on the good soil this is the person who hears the word and understands it he bears fruit and produces a crop yielding in one case a hundred in another sixty and in another thirty times as much as was planted 
jesus presented another parable to them he said the kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field
but while people slept his enemy came and also sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away
when the blades sprouted and then produced their crop then the weeds appeared also 
the servants of the landowner came and said to him sir did you not sow good seed in your field how does it now have weeds
he said to them an enemy has done this the servants said to him so do you want us to go and pull them out 
the landowner said no because while you are pulling out the weeds you might uproot the wheat with them
let both grow together until the harvest at the time of the harvest i will say to the reapers first pull out the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn 
then jesus presented another parable to them he said the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field
this seed is indeed the smallest of all seeds but when it has grown it is greater than the garden plants it becomes a tree so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches 
jesus then told them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all the dough had risen 
all these things jesus said to the crowds in parables and he said nothing to them without a parable
this was in order that what had been said through the prophet might be fulfilled when he said i will open my mouth in parables  i will say things that were hidden from the foundation of the world 
then jesus left the crowds and went into the house his disciples came to him and said explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field
jesus answered and said he who sows the good seed is the son of man
the field is the world and the good seed these are the sons of the kingdom the weeds are the sons of the evil one
and the enemy who sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are angels 
therefore as the weeds are gathered up and consumed by fire so will it be at the end of the age
the son of man will send out his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all stumbling blocks and those who commit lawlessness
they will throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth
then will the righteous people shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father he who has ears let him hear 
the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field a man found it and hid it in his joy he goes sells everything he possesses and buys that field
again the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a merchant looking for valuable pearls
when he found one very valuable pearl he went and sold everything that he possessed and bought it 
again the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and that gathered all kinds of fish
when it was filled the fishermen drew it up on the beach then they sat down and gathered the good ones into containers but the bad ones they threw away 
it will be this way at the end of the age the angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous
they will throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth 
have you understood all these things the disciples said to him yes
then jesus said to them therefore every scribe who has become a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is the owner of a house who draws out old and new things from his treasure
then it came about that when jesus had finished these parables he departed from that place 
then jesus entered his own region and taught the people in their synagogue the result was that they were astonished and said where does this man get his wisdom and these miraculous powers from
is not this man the carpenters son is not his mother called mary are not his brothers james joseph simon and judas
are not all his sisters with us where did he get all these things 
they were offended by him but jesus said to them a prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own family
he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief  
about that time herod the tetrarch heard the news about jesus
he said to his servants this is john the baptist he has risen from the dead therefore these powers are at work in him 
for herod had arrested john bound him and put him in prison because of herodias his brother philips wife
for john had said to him it is not lawful for you to have her as your wife
herod would have killed him but he feared the people because they regarded him as a prophet 
but when herods birthday came the daughter of herodias danced in the midst and pleased herod
in response he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask 
after being instructed by her mother she said give me here on a platter the head of john the baptist
the king was grieved by her request but because of his oath and because of all those at dinner with him he ordered that it should be done 
he sent and beheaded john in the prison
then his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl and she took it to her mother
then his disciples came took up the corpse and buried it after this they went and told jesus 
now when jesus heard this he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place when the crowds heard of it they followed him on foot from the cities
then jesus came before them and saw the large crowd he had compassion on them and healed their sick 
when the evening had come the disciples came to him and said this is a deserted place and the hour has already passed dismiss the crowds so that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves 
but jesus said to them they have no need to go away you give them something to eat
they said to him we have here only five loaves of bread and two fish
jesus said bring them to me 
then jesus ordered the crowd to sit down on the grass he took the five loaves and the two fish looking up to heaven he blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowd
they all ate and were filled then they took up what remained of the broken pieces of foodtwelve baskets full
those who ate were about five thousand men besides women and children 
immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side while he sent away the crowds
after he had sent away the crowds he went up on the mountain by himself to pray when evening came he was there alone
but the boat was now a long way from land being tossed about by the waves for the wind was blowing against them 
in the fourth watch of the night jesus approached them walking on the sea
when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled and said it is a ghost and they cried out in fear
but jesus spoke to them right away and said be brave it is i do not be afraid 
peter answered him and said lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water
jesus said come so peter got out from the boat and walked on the water to go to jesus
but when peter saw the strong wind he became afraid as he began to sink he cried out and said lord save me 
jesus immediately stretched out his hand took hold of peter and said to him you of little faith why did you doubt
then when jesus and peter went into the boat the wind ceased blowing
then the disciples in the boat worshiped jesus and said truly you are the son of god 
when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret
when the men in that place recognized jesus they sent messages everywhere into the surrounding area and they brought to him everyone who was sick
they begged him that they might just touch the edge of his garment and as many as touched it were healed  
then some pharisees and scribes came to jesus from jerusalem they said
why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread
he answered and said to them then why do you violate the commandment of god for the sake of your traditions 
for god said honor your father and your mother and he who speaks evil of his father or mother will surely die
but you say whoever says to his father or mother whatever help you would have received from me is now a gift given to god
that person does not need to honor his father in this way you have made void the word of god  the best ancient copies have the word of god  some other ancient copies have the commandmentit is difficult to choose the better reading for the sake of your traditions 
you hypocrites well did isaiah prophesy about you when he said
this people honors me with their lips  but their heart is far from me
they worship me in vain  because they teach as their doctrines the commandments of people 
then he called the crowd to himself and said to them listen and understand
nothing that enters into the mouth defiles a person instead what comes out of the mouth this is what defiles a person 
then the disciples came and said to jesus do you know that the pharisees were offended when they heard this statement
jesus answered and said every plant that my heavenly father has not planted will be rooted up
let them alone they are blind guides if a blind person guides another blind person both will fall into a pit 
peter responded and said to jesus explain this parable to us
jesus said are you also still without understanding
do you not understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and then goes out into the latrine 
but the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart they are the things that defile a person
for from the heart proceed evil thoughts murder adultery sexual immorality theft false witness and slander
these are the things that defile a person but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a person 
then jesus went away from there and withdrew toward the regions of the cities of tyre and sidon
behold a canaanite woman came out from that region she shouted out and said have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is severely demonpossessed
but jesus answered her not a word his disciples came and begged him saying send her away for she is shouting after us 
but jesus answered and said i was not sent to anyone except to the lost sheep of the house of israel
but she came and bowed down before him saying lord help me
he answered and said it is not proper to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs 
she said yes lord but even the dogs eat some of the crumbs that fall from their masters tables
then jesus answered and said to her woman great is your faith let it be done for you just as you wish her daughter was healed from that hour 
jesus left that place and went near to the sea of galilee then he went up a hill and sat there
large crowds came to him they brought with them lame blind mute and crippled people and many others who were sick they presented them at jesus feet and he healed them
so the crowd marveled when they saw the mute persons speak the crippled made well the lame walking and the blind seeing they glorified the god of israel 
jesus called his disciples to him and said i have compassion on the crowd because they have stayed with me for three days already and have nothing to eat i do not want to send them away without eating or they may faint on the way
the disciples said to him where can we get enough loaves of bread in such a deserted place to satisfy so large a crowd
jesus said to them how many loaves do you have they said seven and a few small fish
then jesus commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground 
he took the seven loaves and the fish and after giving thanks he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples the disciples gave them to the crowd
the people all ate and were satisfied then they gathered up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over
those who ate were four thousand men besides women and children
then jesus sent the crowds away and got into the boat and went into the region of magadan  
the pharisees and sadducees came and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from the sky
but he answered and said to them when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red 
when it is morning you say it will be foul weather for the sky is red and overcast you know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but you cannot interpret the signs of the times
an evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah then jesus left them and went away 
when the disciples reached the other side they had forgotten to take bread
jesus said to them watch out and beware of the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees
the disciples reasoned among themselves and said it is because we took no bread
jesus was aware of this and said you of little faith why do you reason among yourselves and say that it is because you have taken no bread 
do you not understand do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you gathered up
or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up 
how is it that you do not understand that i was not speaking to you about bread watch out and beware of the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees
then they understood that he was not telling them to beware of yeast in bread but to beware of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees 
now when jesus came to the regions near caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying who do people say that the son of man is
they said some say john the baptist some elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets
he said to them but who do you say that i am
answering simon peter said you are the christ the son of the living god 
jesus answered and said to him blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven
i also say to you that you are peter and upon this rock i will build my church the gates of hades will not prevail against it 
i will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
then jesus commanded the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the christ 
from that time jesus started to tell his disciples that he must go to jerusalem suffer many things at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes be killed and be raised back to life on the third day
then peter took him aside and rebuked him saying may this be far from you lord may this never happen to you
but jesus turned and said to peter get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me for you do not think about the things of god but about the things of people 
then jesus said to his disciples if anyone wants to follow me he must deny himself take up his cross and follow me
for whoever wants to save his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it
for what does it profit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life what can a person give in exchange for his life 
for the son of man will come in the glory of his father with his angels then he will reward every person according to his deeds
truly i say to you there are some of you standing here who will not taste death until they see the son of man coming in his kingdom  
six days later jesus took with him peter james and john his brother and brought them up a high mountain by themselves
he was transfigured before them his face shone like the sun and his garments became as brilliant as the light 
behold there appeared to them moses and elijah talking with him
peter answered and said to jesus lord it is good for us to be here if you desire i will make here three sheltersone for you and one for moses and one for elijah 
while he was still speaking behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold there was a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased listen to him
when the disciples heard it they fell facedown and were very afraid
then jesus came and touched them and said get up and do not be afraid
then they looked up but saw no one except jesus only 
as they were coming down the mountain jesus commanded them saying report this vision to no one until the son of man has risen from the dead
his disciples asked him saying why then do the scribes say that elijah must come first 
jesus answered and said elijah will indeed come and restore all things
but i tell you elijah has already come but they did not recognize him instead they did whatever they wanted to him in the same way the son of man will also suffer at their hands
then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about john the baptist 
when they had come to the crowd a man came to him knelt before him and said
lord have mercy on my son for he is epileptic and suffers severely for he often falls into the fire or the water
i brought him to your disciples but they could not cure him 
jesus answered and said unbelieving and perverse generation how long will i have to stay with you how long must i bear with you bring him here to me
jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the boy was healed from that hour 
then the disciples came to jesus privately and said why could we not cast it out
jesus said to them because of your small faith for i truly say to you if you have faith even as small as a grain of mustard seed you can say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you
 the best ancient copies do not have v  but this kind of demon does not go out except with prayer and fasting  
while they stayed in galilee jesus said to his disciples the son of man will be given over into the hands of people
and they will kill him and the third day he will be raised up the disciples were deeply grieved 
when they had come to capernaum the men who collected the twodrachma tax came to peter and said does not your teacher pay the twodrachma tax
he said yes when peter came into the house jesus spoke to him first and said what do you think simon from whom do the kings of the earth collect tolls or taxes from their sons or from others 
from others peter answered then the sons are free jesus said
but so that we do not cause the tax collectors to stumble go to the sea throw in a hook and draw in the fish that comes up first when you have opened its mouth you will find a shekel take it and give it to the tax collectors for me and you  
at that time the disciples came to jesus and said who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
jesus called to himself a little child set him among them
and said truly i say to you unless you turn and become like little children you will in no way enter the kingdom of heaven 
therefore whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name receives me
but whoever causes one of these little ones who believes in me to stumble it would be better for him that a large millstone should be hung about his neck and that he should be sunk into the depths of the sea 
woe to the world because of stumbling blocks for it is necessary that those stumbling blocks come but woe to the person through whom those stumbling blocks come
if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away from you it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to be thrown into the eternal fire having two hands or two feet 
if your eye causes you to stumble pluck it out and throw it away from you it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to be thrown into the fiery hell having both eyes 
see that you do not despise any of these little ones for i say to you that in heaven their angels always look on the face of my father who is in heaven
 the best ancient greek copies do not have the sentence that some translations include for the son of man came to save that which was lost  
what do you think if anyone has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray does he not leave the ninetynine on the hillside and go off seeking the one that went astray
if he finds it truly i say to you he rejoices over it more than over the ninetynine that did not go astray
in the same way it is not the will of your father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish 
if your brother sins against you go and rebuke him between you and him alone if he listens to you you will have gained your brother
but if he does not listen to you take one or two others along with you so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might be confirmed 
and if he refuses to listen to them tell the matter to the church if he also refuses to listen to the church let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector 
i tell you truly whatever things you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
again i tell you truly if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask it will be done for them by my father who is in heaven
for where two or three are gathered together in my name there i am in their midst 
then peter came and said to jesus lord how often will my brother sin against me and i forgive him until seven times
jesus said to him i do not tell you seven times but until seventy times seven 
therefore the kingdom of heaven is similar to a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants
as he began the settling one servant was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents
but since he did not have the means to repay his master commanded him to be sold together with his wife and children and everything that he had and payment to be made 
so the servant fell down bowed down before him and said master have patience with me and i will pay you everything
so the master of that servant since he was moved with compassion released him and forgave him the debt 
but that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him one hundred denarii he took hold of him began to choke him and said pay me what you owe
but his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him saying have patience with me and i will repay you 
but the first servant refused instead he went and threw him into prison until he should pay him what he owed
when his fellow servants saw what had happened they were deeply grieved they came and told their master everything that had happened 
then that servants master called him and said to him you wicked servant i forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me
should you not have had mercy on your fellow servant even as i had mercy on you 
his master was angry and handed him over to the torturers until he would pay all that was owed
so also my heavenly father will do to you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart  
it came about that when jesus had finished these words he departed from galilee and came to the region of judea that is beyond the jordan river
great crowds followed him and he healed them there 
pharisees came to him testing him saying to him is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause
jesus answered and said have you not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female 
he who made them also said for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and join to his wife and the two will become one flesh
so they are no longer two but one flesh therefore what god has joined together let no one tear apart 
they said to him why then did moses command us to give a certificate of divorce and then to send her away
he said to them for your hardness of heart moses allowed you to divorce your wives but from the beginning it was not that way
i say to you whoever divorces his wife except for sexual immorality and marries another commits adultery  the best ancient copies do not have and the man who marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery  
the disciples said to jesus if that is the case of a man with his wife it is not good to marry
but jesus said to them not everyone can accept this saying but only those to whom it is given
for there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mothers womb and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven he who is able to accept this teaching let him accept it 
then some little children were brought to him so that he would lay his hands on them and pray but the disciples rebuked them
but jesus said permit the little children and do not forbid them to come to me for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such ones
he placed his hands on the children and then he went away from there 
behold a man came to jesus and said teacher what good thing must i do that i may have eternal life
jesus said to him why do you ask me about what is good only one is good but if you want to enter into life keep the commandments 
the man said to him which commandments jesus said do not murder do not commit adultery do not steal do not bear false witness
honor your father and your mother and love your neighbor as yourself 
the young man said to him all these things i have obeyed what do i still need
jesus said to him if you wish to be perfect go sell your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me
but when the young man heard what jesus said he went away sorrowful for he had many possessions 
jesus said to his disciples truly i say to you it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven
again i say to you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god 
when the disciples heard it they were very astonished and said who then can be saved
jesus looked at them and said with people this is impossible but with god all things are possible
then peter answered and said to him see we have left everything and followed you what then will we have 
jesus said to them truly i say to you in the new age when the son of man sits on his glorious throne you who have followed me will also sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel 
every one who has left houses brothers sisters father mother children or land for my names sake will receive one hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life
but many who are first will be last and the last will be first  
for the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard
after he had agreed with the laborers for one denarius a day he sent them into his vineyard 
he went out again about the third hour and saw other laborers standing idle in the marketplace
to them he said you also go into the vineyard and i will give you what is right so they went to work 
again he went out about the sixth hour and again the ninth hour and did the same
once more about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle he said to them why do you stand here idle all the day long
they said to him because no one has hired us he said to them you also go into the vineyard 
when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his manager call the laborers and pay them their wages beginning from the last to the first
when the laborers who had been hired at the eleventh hour came each of them received a denarius
when the first laborers came they thought that they would receive more but they also received one denarius each 
when they received their wages they complained about the landowner
they said these last laborers have spent only one hour in work but you have made them equal to us we who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat 
but the owner answered and said to one of them friend i do you no wrong did you not agree with me for one denarius
take what belongs to you and go your way i choose to give to these last hired laborers just the same as to you 
is it not lawful for me to do as i want with what belongs to me or are you envious because i am good
so the last will be first and the first last  the best ancient copies do not have many are called but few are chosen  
as jesus was going up to jerusalem he took the twelve disciples aside and on the way he said to them
see we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be given over to the chief priests and scribes they will condemn him to death
and will deliver him to the gentiles for them to mock to flog and to crucify him but on the third day he will be raised up 
then the mother of the sons of zebedee came to jesus with her sons she bowed down before him and asked for something from him
jesus said to her what do you wish she said to him command that these my two sons may sit one at your right hand and one at your left hand in your kingdom 
but jesus answered and said you do not know what you are asking are you able to drink the cup that i am about to drink they said to him we are able
he said to them my cup you will indeed drink but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my father
when the other ten disciples heard this they were very angry with the two brothers 
but jesus called them to himself and said you know that the rulers of the gentiles dominate them and their important men exercise authority over them
but it must not be this way among you instead whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant
and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your servant
just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many 
as they went out from jericho a great crowd followed him
there were two blind men sitting by the road when they heard that jesus was passing by they shouted lord son of david have mercy on us
the crowd rebuked them telling them to be quiet but they cried out even more loudly lord son of david have mercy on us 
then jesus stood still and called to them and said what do you wish me to do for you
they said to him lord that our eyes may be opened
then jesus being moved with compassion touched their eyes immediately they received their sight and followed him  
as jesus and his disciples approached jerusalem and came to bethphage to the mount of olives then jesus sent two disciples
saying to them go into the next village and you will immediately find a donkey tied up there and a colt with her untie them and bring them to me
if anyone says anything to you about that you will say the lord has need of them and that person will immediately send them with you 
now all this happened to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet saying
tell the daughter of zion  see your king is coming to you humble and riding on a donkey  on a colt the foal of a donkey 
then the disciples went and did just as jesus had instructed them
they brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them and jesus sat upon the cloaks
most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road and others cut branches off the trees and spread them in the road 
then the crowds that went before jesus and those that followed him were shouting hosanna to the son of david blessed is the one who comes in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest
when jesus had come into jerusalem all the city was stirred and said who is this
the crowds answered this is jesus the prophet from nazareth in galilee 
then jesus entered the temple he cast out all those who bought and sold in the temple and turned over the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves
he said to them it is written my house will be called a house of prayer but you make it a den of robbers
then the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them 
but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things that he did and when they heard the children shouting in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they became very angry
they said to him do you hear what they are saying jesus said to them yes but have you never read out of the mouths of little children and nursing infants  you have prepared praise
then jesus left them and went out of the city to bethany and spent the night there 
now in the morning as he returned to the city he was hungry
seeing a fig tree along the roadside he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves he said to it may there be no fruit from you ever again and immediately the fig tree withered 
when the disciples saw it they marveled and said how did the fig tree immediately wither away
jesus answered and said to them truly i say to you if you have faith and do not doubt you will not only do what was done to this fig tree but you will even say to this mountain be taken up and thrown into the sea and it will be done
whatever you ask for in prayer believing you will receive 
when jesus had come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said by what authority do you do these things and who gave you this authority
jesus answered and said to them i also will ask you one question if you tell me i will tell you by what authority i do these things 
the baptism of johnfrom where did it come from heaven or from men they discussed among themselves saying if we say from heaven he will say to us why then did you not believe him
but if we say from men we fear the crowd because they all view john as a prophet
then they answered jesus and said we do not know he also said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i do these things 
but what do you think a man had two sons he went to the first and said son go labor today in the vineyard
the son answered and said i will not but afterward he changed his mind and went
then the man went to the second son and said the same thing he answered and said i will go sir but he did not go 
which of the two sons did his fathers will they said the first one jesus said to them truly i say to you the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of god before you do
for john came to you in the way of righteousness but you did not believe him but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him but you even when you saw this you did not repent afterward and believe him 
listen to another parable there was a man a landowner he planted a vineyard set a hedge about it dug a winepress in it built a watchtower and rented it out to vine growers then he went into another country
when the time of the fruit harvest approached he sent some servants to the vine growers to collect his fruit 
but the vine growers took his servants beat one killed another and stoned still another
again the owner sent other servants more than the first but the vine growers treated them in the same way
after that the owner sent his own son to them saying they will respect my son 
but when the vine growers saw the son they said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and take over the inheritance
so they took him threw him out of the vineyard and killed him 
now when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those vine growers
they said to him he will violently destroy those wicked people and he will then rent out the vineyard to other vine growers men who will give him his share of crops at the harvest time 
jesus said to them did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected  has been made the cornerstone this was from the lord  and it is marvelous in our eyes 
therefore i say to you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation that produces its fruits
whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces but anyone on whom it falls will be crushed 
when the chief priests and the pharisees heard his parables they understood he was speaking about them
seeking to arrest him they were afraid of the crowd because the people regarded him as a prophet  
jesus spoke to them again in parables saying
the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who prepared a marriage feast for his son
he sent out his servants to call those who had been invited to come to the marriage feast but they would not come 
again the king sent other servants saying tell them who are invited see i have prepared my dinner my oxen and fattened cattle have been killed and all things are ready come to the marriage feast 
but they paid no attention and went away one to his farm another to his business
the others seized the kings servants treated them shamefully and killed them
the king was angry and he sent his soldiers and they destroyed those murderers and burned their city 
then he said to his servants the wedding is ready but those who were invited were not worthy
therefore go to the highway crossings and invite as many people to the marriage feast as you can find
the servants went out to the highways and gathered together all the people they found both bad and good so the wedding hall was filled with guests 
but when the king came in to look at the guests he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes
the king said to him friend how did you come in here without wedding clothes but the man was speechless 
then the king said to the servants bind this man hand and foot and throw him out into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and the grinding of teeth
for many people are called but few are chosen 
then the pharisees went and planned how they might entrap jesus in his own talk
then they sent to him their disciples together with the herodians they said to jesus teacher we know that you are truthful and that you teach gods way in truth you care for no ones opinion and you do not show partiality between people
so tell us what do you think is it lawful to pay taxes to caesar or not 
but jesus understood their wickedness and said why are you testing me you hypocrites
show me the coin for the tax then they brought a denarius to him 
jesus said to them whose image and name are these
they said to him caesars then jesus said to them then give to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods
when they heard it they marveled then they left him and went away 
on that day some sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him they asked him
saying teacher moses said if a man dies having no children his brother must marry his wife and raise children for his brother 
there were seven brothers the first married and then died having left no children he left his wife to his brother
then the second brother did the same thing then the third all the way to the seventh brother
after them all the woman died
now in the resurrection whose wife will she be of the seven brothers for they all had married her 
but jesus answered and said to them you are mistaken because you do not know the scriptures or the power of god
for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage instead they are like angels in heaven 
but concerning the resurrection of the dead have you not read what was spoken to you by god saying
i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not the god of the dead but of the living
when the crowds heard this they were astonished at his teaching 
but when the pharisees heard that jesus had silenced the sadducees they gathered themselves together
one of them an expert in the law asked him a question testing him
teacher which is the greatest commandment in the law 
jesus said to him love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind
this is the great and first commandment 
and a second commandment is like itlove your neighbor as yourself
on these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets 
now while the pharisees were still gathered together jesus asked them a question
he said what do you think about the christ whose son is he they said to him the son of david 
jesus said to them how then does david in the spirit call him lord saying
the lord said to my lord  sit at my right hand  until i make your enemies your footstool 
if david then calls the christ lord how is he davids son
no one was able to answer him a word and no man dared ask him any more questions from that day on  
then jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples
he said the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat
therefore whatever they command you to do do these things and observe them but do not imitate their deeds for they say things but then do not do them 
yes they bind heavy burdens that are difficult to carry and then they put them on peoples shoulders but they themselves will not move a finger to carry them
they do all their deeds to be seen by people for they make their phylacteries wide and they enlarge the edges of their garments 
they love the places of honor at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues
and special greetings in the marketplaces and to be called rabbi by people 
but you must not be called rabbi for you have only one teacher and all of you are brothers
and call no man on earth your father for you have only one father and he is in heaven
neither must you be called teacher for you have only one teacher the christ 
but he who is greatest among you will be your servant
whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted 
but woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites you shut the kingdom of heaven against people for you do not enter it yourselves and neither do you allow those about to enter to do so
 the best ancient copies do not have verse  some copies add the verse after verse  woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you devour widows houses while you make a show of long prayers you will therefore receive greater condemnation 
woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you go over sea and land to make one convert and when he has become one you make him twice as much a son of hell as you 
woe to you you blind guides you who say whoever swears by the temple it is nothing but whoever swears by the gold of the temple he is bound to his oath
you blind fools which is greater the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy 
and whoever swears by the altar it is nothing but whoever swears by the gift that is on it he is bound to his oath
you blind people which is greater the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy 
therefore he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it
the one who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who lives in it
and the one who swears by heaven swears by the throne of god and by him who sits on it 
woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you tithe mint and dill and cumin but you have left undone the weightier matters of the lawjustice and mercy and faithfulness but these you ought to have done and not to have left the other undone
you blind guides you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel 
woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate but inside they are full of robbery and selfindulgence
you blind pharisee clean first the inside of the cup and of the plate so that the outside may become clean also 
woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside look beautiful but on the inside are full of dead mens bones and everything unclean
in the same way you also outwardly appear righteous to men but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness 
woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous
you say if we had lived in the days of our fathers we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets
therefore you testify against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets 
you also fill up the measure of your fathers
you serpents you offspring of vipers how will you escape the judgment of hell 
therefore see i am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes some of them you will kill and crucify and some you will whip in your synagogues and chase from city to city
the result is that upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on the earth from the blood of righteous abel to the blood of zechariah son of berekiah whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar
truly i say to you all these things will come upon this generation 
jerusalem jerusalem you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you how often did i long to gather your children together just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings but you were not willing
see your house is left to you desolate
for i say to you you will not see me from now on until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord  
jesus went out from the temple and was going on his way his disciples came to him to point out to him the buildings of the temple
but he answered and said to them do you not see all these things truly i say to you not one stone will be left on another that will not be torn down 
as he sat on the mount of olives the disciples came to him privately and said tell us when will these things happen what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age
jesus answered and said to them be careful that no one leads you astray
for many will come in my name they will say i am the christ and will lead many astray 
you will hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you are not troubled for these things must happen but the end is not yet
for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be famines and earthquakes in various places
but all these things are only the beginning of birth pains 
then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you you will be hated by all the nations for my names sake
then many will stumble and betray one another and hate one another
many false prophets will rise up and lead many astray 
because lawlessness will increase the love of many will grow cold
but the one who endures to the end will be saved
this good news of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations then the end will come 
therefore when you see the abomination of desolation which was spoken of by daniel the prophet standing in the holy place let the reader understand
let those who are in judea flee to the mountains
let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house
and let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak 
but woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days
pray that your flight will not occur in the winter or on a sabbath
for there will be great tribulation such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now no nor ever will be again
unless those days had been shortened no flesh would be saved but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened 
then if anyone says to you look here is the christ or there is the christ do not believe it
for false christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray if possible even the elect
see i have told you ahead of time 
therefore if they say to you look he is in the wilderness do not go out to the wilderness or see he is in the inner rooms do not believe it
for as the lightning shines out from the east and flashes all the way to the west so will be the coming of the son of man
wherever a dead animal is there the vultures will gather 
but immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened  the moon will not give its light the stars will fall from the sky  and the powers of the heavens will be shaken 
then the sign of the son of man will appear in the sky and all the tribes of the earth will mourn they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory
he will send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they will gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of the sky to the other 
learn a lesson from the fig tree as soon as the branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves you know that summer is near
so also when you see all these things you should know that he is near at the very gates 
truly i say to you this generation will not pass away until all of these things will have happened
heaven and the earth will pass away but my words will never pass away 
but concerning that day and hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven nor the son but only the father 
as the days of noah were so will be the coming of the son of man
for as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered the ark
and they knew nothing until the flood came and took them all awayso will be the coming of the son of man 
then two men will be in a fieldone will be taken and one will be left
two women will be grinding with a millone will be taken and one will be left
therefore be on your guard for you do not know on what day your lord will come 
but know this that if the master of the house had known in what time of night the thief was coming he would have been on guard and would not have allowed his house to be broken into
therefore you must also be ready for the son of man will come at an hour that you do not expect 
so who is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has set over his household in order to give them their food at the right time
blessed is that servant whom his master will find doing that when he comes
truly i say to you that the master will set him over all his possessions 
but if an evil servant says in his heart my master has been delayed
and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards
then the master of that servant will come on a day that the servant does not expect and at an hour that he does not know
his master will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth  
then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom
five of them were foolish and five were wise
for when the foolish virgins took their lamps they did not take any oil with them
but the wise virgins took containers of oil along with their lamps 
now while the bridegroom was delayed they all got sleepy and slept
but at midnight there was a cry look the bridegroom go out and meet him 
then all those virgins rose up and trimmed their lamps
the foolish said to the wise give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out
but the wise answered and said since there will not be enough for us and you go instead to those who sell and buy some for yourselves 
while they went away to buy the bridegroom came and those who were ready went with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut
afterward the other virgins also came and said master master open for us
but he answered and said truly i say to you i do not know you
watch therefore for you do not know the day or the hour 
for it is like when a man was about to go into another country he called his own servants and entrusted his possessions to them
to one of them he gave five talents to another he gave two and to yet another he gave one talent each one received an amount according to his own ability and that man went on his journey
the one who received the five talents went at once and worked with them and gained another five talents 
in the same way the one who had received two talents gained another two
but the servant who had received one talent went away dug a hole in the ground and hid his masters money 
now after a long time the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them
the servant who had received the five talents came and brought another five talents he said master you entrusted me with five talents see i have gained five talents more
his master said to him well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful over a few things i will put you in charge over many things enter into the joy of your master 
the servant who had received two talents came and said master you gave me two talents see i have gained two more talents
his master said to him well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful over a few things i will put you in charge over many things enter into the joy of your master 
then the servant who had received one talent came and said master i know that you are a hard man you reap where you did not sow and you harvest where you did not scatter
i was afraid so i went away and hid your talent in the ground see you have here what belongs to you 
but his master answered and said to him you wicked and lazy servant you knew that i reap where i have not sowed and harvest where i have not scattered
therefore you should have given my money to the bankers and at my coming i would have received back my own with interest 
therefore take away the talent from him and give it to the servant who has ten talents
for to everyone who possesses more will be given and he will have an abundance but from anyone who does not possess anything even what he does have will be taken away
throw the worthless servant out into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth 
when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then he will sit on his glorious throne
before him will be gathered all the nations and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats
he will place the sheep on his right hand but the goats on his left 
then the king will say to those on his right hand come you who have been blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me a drink i was a stranger and you took me in
i was naked and you clothed me i was sick and you cared for me i was in prison and you came to me 
then the righteous will answer and say lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you a drink
when did we see you a stranger and take you in or naked and clothe you
when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you
then the king will answer and say to them truly i say to you what you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did it for me 
then he will say to those on his left hand depart from me you cursed into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels
because i was hungry but you did not give me food i was thirsty but you did not give me a drink
i was a stranger but you did not take me in naked but you did not clothe me sick and in prison but you did not care for me 
then they will also answer and say lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not serve you
then he will answer them and say truly i say to you what you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
these will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life  
it came about that when jesus had finished all these words he said to his disciples
you know that after two days the passover is coming and the son of man will be given over to be crucified 
then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the palace of the high priest who was named caiaphas
they plotted together to arrest jesus stealthily and kill him
for they were saying not during the festival so that a riot does not arise among the people 
now while jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper
as he was reclining at table a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment and she poured it upon his head
but when his disciples saw it they became angry and said what is the reason for this waste
this could have been sold for a large amount and given to the poor 
but jesus knowing this said to them why are you causing trouble for this woman for she has done a beautiful thing for me
you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me 
for when she poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial
truly i say to you wherever this good news is preached in the whole world what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her 
then one of the twelve who was named judas iscariot went to the chief priests
and said what are you willing to give me to turn him over to you they weighed out thirty pieces of silver for him
from that moment he sought an opportunity to turn him over to them 
now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus and said where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the passover meal
he said go into the city to a certain man and say to him the teacher says my time is at hand i will keep the passover at your house with my disciples
the disciples did as jesus directed them and they prepared the passover meal 
when evening came he sat down to eat with the twelve disciples
as they were eating he said truly i say to you that one of you will betray me
they were very sorrowful and each one began to ask him surely not i lord 
he answered the one who dips his hand with me in the dish is the one who will betray me
the son of man will go just as it is written about him but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it would be better for that man if he had not been born
judas who would betray him said is it i rabbi he said to him you have said it yourself 
as they were eating jesus took bread blessed it and broke it he gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body 
he took a cup and gave thanks and gave it to them and said drink it all of you
for this is my blood of the covenant that is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins
but i say to you i will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom 
when they had sung a hymn they went out to the mount of olives
then jesus said to them all of you will fall away tonight because of me for it is written i will strike the shepherd  and the sheep of the flock will be scattered
but after i am raised up i will go ahead of you into galilee 
but peter said to him even if all fall away because of you i will never fall away
jesus said to him truly i say to you this very night before the rooster crows you will deny me three times
peter said to him even if i must die with you i will not deny you all the other disciples said the same thing 
then jesus went with them to a place called gethsemane and said to his disciples sit here while i go over there and pray
he took peter and the two sons of zebedee with him and began to become sorrowful and troubled
then he said to them my soul is deeply sorrowful even to death remain here and watch with me 
he went a little farther fell on his face and prayed he said my father if it is possible let this cup pass from me yet not as i will but as you will
he came to the disciples and found them sleeping and he said to peter what could you not watch with me for one hour
watch and pray that you do not enter into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak 
he went away a second time and prayed he said my father if this cannot pass away unless i drink it your will be done
he came again and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy
so leaving them again he went away and prayed a third time saying the same words 
then jesus came to the disciples and said to them are you still sleeping and taking your rest look the hour is at hand and the son of man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners
arise let us go look the one who is betraying me is near 
while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve came a large crowd came with him from the chief priests and elders of the people they came with swords and clubs
now the man who was going to betray jesus had given them a signal saying the one i kiss is the man seize him 
immediately he came up to jesus and said greetings rabbi and he kissed him
jesus said to him friend do what you have come to do then they came laid hands on jesus and seized him 
behold one of those who was with jesus stretched out his hand drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear
then jesus said to him put your sword back in its place for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword
do you think that i could not call upon my father and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels
but how then would the scriptures be fulfilled that this must happen 
at that time jesus said to the crowd have you come out with swords and clubs to seize me like a robber every day i sat teaching in the temple and you did not arrest me
but all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples abandoned him and fled 
those who had seized jesus led him away to caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders had gathered together
but peter followed him from a distance to the courtyard of the high priest he went inside and sat down with the officers to see the outcome 
now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against jesus so that they might put him to death
they did not find any even though many false witnesses came forward but later two came forward
and said this man said i am able to destroy the temple of god and rebuild it in three days 
the high priest stood up and said to him do you have no answer what is it that they are testifying against you
but jesus was silent the high priest said to him i command you by the living god tell us whether you are the christ the son of god
jesus replied to him you have said it yourself but i tell you from now on you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven 
then the high priest tore his clothes and said he has spoken blasphemy why do we still need witnesses look now you have heard the blasphemy
what do you think they answered and said he is deserving of death 
then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists while some slapped him
and said prophesy to us you christ who is it that struck you 
now peter was sitting outside in the courtyard and a servant girl came to him and said you were also with jesus of galilee
but he denied it in front of them all saying i do not know what you are talking about 
when he went out to the gateway another servant girl saw him and said to those there this man was also with jesus of nazareth
he again denied it with an oath i do not know the man 
after a little while those who were standing by came and said to peter surely you are also one of them for the way you speak gives you away
then he began to curse and swear i do not know the man and immediately a rooster crowed
peter remembered the words that jesus had said before the rooster crows you will deny me three times then he went outside and wept bitterly  
now when morning came all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against jesus to put him to death
they bound him led him away and delivered him to pilate the governor 
then when judas who had betrayed him saw that jesus had been condemned he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders
and said i have sinned by betraying innocent blood but they said what is that to us see to that yourself
then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went out and hanged himself 
the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said it is not lawful to put this into the treasury because it is the price of blood
they discussed the matter together and they bought with the money the potters field in which to bury strangers
for this reason that field has been called the field of blood to this day 
then that which had been spoken by jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled saying they took the thirty pieces of silver the price set on him by the sons of israel
and they gave it for the potters field as the lord had directed me 
now jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him are you the king of the jews jesus answered him you say so
but when he was accused by the chief priests and elders he answered nothing
then pilate said to him do you not hear how many things they accuse you of
but he did not answer even one word so that the governor was greatly amazed 
now at the festival it was the custom of the governor to set free one prisoner chosen by the crowd
at that time they had a notorious prisoner named jesus barabbas  many ancient copies do not have jesus  
so when they were gathered together pilate said to them who do you want me to set free for you barabbas or jesus who is called christ
he knew that they had handed jesus over to him because of envy
while he was sitting on the judgment seat his wife sent word to him and said have nothing to do with that innocent man for i have suffered much today because of a dream i had about him 
now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd that they should ask for barabbas and destroy jesus
the governor asked them which of the two do you want me to set free for you they said barabbas
pilate said to them what should i do with jesus who is called christ they all answered crucify him 
then he said why what evil has he done but they cried out even louder crucify him
so when pilate saw that he was gaining nothing but instead a riot was starting he took water washed his hands in front of the crowd and said i am innocent of the blood of this man you see to it 
all the people said may his blood be on us and our children
then he set barabbas free for them but he scourged jesus and handed him over to be crucified 
then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the government headquarters and they gathered the whole company of soldiers
they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him
they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head and placed a staff in his right hand they knelt down before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews 
they spat on him and they took the staff and struck him on the head again and again
when they had mocked him they took the robe off him and put his own garments on him and led him away to crucify him 
as they came out they found a man from cyrene named simon whom they forced to go with them so that he might carry his cross
they came to a place called golgotha which means the place of a skull
they gave him wine to drink mixed with gall but when he tasted it he would not drink 
when they had crucified him they divided up his garments by casting lots
and they sat and kept guard over him
above his head they put the charge against him which read this is jesus the king of the jews 
two robbers were crucified with him one on the right of him and one on the left
those who passed by insulted him shaking their heads
and saying you who were going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days save yourself if you are the son of god come down from the cross 
in the same way the chief priests were mocking him along with the scribes and elders and said
he saved others but he cannot save himself he is the king of israel let him come down off the cross and then we will believe in him 
he trusts in god let god rescue him now if god consents to release him for he even said i am the son of god
in the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also insulted him 
now from the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour
about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice and said eli eli lama sabachthani which means my god my god why have you abandoned me
when some of those who were standing there heard it they said he is calling for elijah 
immediately one of them ran and took a sponge filled it with sour wine put it on a reed staff and gave it to him to drink
the rest of them said leave him alone let us see whether elijah comes to save him
then jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit 
behold the curtain of the temple was split in two from the top to the bottom and the earth shook and the rocks split apart
the tombs were opened and the bodies of the holy people who had fallen asleep were raised
they came out of the tombs after his resurrection entered the holy city and appeared to many 
now when the centurion and those who were watching jesus saw the earthquake and the things that had happened they became very afraid and said truly this was the son of god
many women who had followed jesus from galilee to attend to his needs were there watching from a distance
among them were mary magdalene mary the mother of james and joseph and the mother of the sons of zebedee 
when it was evening there came a rich man from arimathea named joseph who was also a disciple of jesus
he approached pilate and asked for the body of jesus then pilate ordered it to be given to him 
joseph took the body wrapped it in a clean linen cloth
and laid it in his own new tomb that he had cut into the rock then he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb and went away
mary magdalene and the other mary were there sitting opposite the tomb 
the next day which was the day after the preparation the chief priests and the pharisees were gathered together with pilate
they said sir we remember that when that deceiver was alive he said after three days will i rise again
therefore command that the tomb be made secure until the third day otherwise his disciples may come and steal him and say to the people he has risen from the dead and the last deception will be worse than the first 
pilate said to them take a guard go and make it as secure as you know how
so they went and made the tomb secure sealing the stone and placing the guard  
now after the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week mary magdalene and the other mary came to see the tomb
behold there was a great earthquake for an angel of the lord descended from heaven came and rolled away the stone and sat on it 
his appearance was like lightning and his clothing as white as snow
the guards shook with fear and became like dead men 
the angel addressed the women and said to them do not be afraid for i know that you seek jesus who has been crucified
he is not here but is risen just as he said come see the place where the lord was lying
go quickly and tell his disciples he has risen from the dead see he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him see i have told you 
the women quickly left the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples
behold jesus met them and said greetings the women came took hold of his feet and worshiped him
then jesus said to them do not be afraid go tell my brothers to leave for galilee there they will see me 
now while the women were going behold some of the guards went into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened
when the priests had met with the elders and discussed the matter with them they gave a large amount of money to the soldiers
and told them say to others the disciples of jesus came by night and stole his body while we were sleeping 
if this report reaches the governor we will persuade him and take any worries away from you
so the soldiers took the money and did as they had been instructed this report spread widely among the jews and continues even today 
but the eleven disciples went to galilee to the mountain to which jesus had directed them
when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted 
jesus came to them and spoke to them and said all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptize them into the name of the father of the son and of the holy spirit 
teach them to obey all the things that i have commanded you. see, i am with you always, even to the end of the age."
this is the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god
as it is written in isaiah the prophet  look i am sending my messenger before your face  the one who will prepare your way
the voice of one crying out in the wilderness  make ready the way of the lord  make his paths straight 
john came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins
the whole country of judea and all the people of jerusalem went out to him they were baptized by him in the jordan river confessing their sins
john wore a coat of camels hair and a leather belt around his waist and he ate locusts and wild honey 
he was preaching saying one will come after me who is more powerful than i the strap of his sandals i am not worthy to stoop down and untie
i baptized you with water but he will baptize you with the holy spirit 
it happened in those days that jesus came from nazareth in galilee and he was baptized by john in the jordan river
as jesus came up out of the water he saw the heavens split open and the spirit coming down on him like a dove
a voice came out of the heavens you are my beloved son i am very pleased with you 
then the spirit compelled him to go out into the wilderness
he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by satan he was with the wild animals and the angels served him 
now after john was arrested jesus came into galilee proclaiming the gospel of god
he said the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is near repent and believe the gospel 
when he was walking beside the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew the brother of simon casting a net in the sea for they were fishermen
jesus said to them come follow me and i will make you fishers of men
then immediately they left the nets and followed him 
as jesus was walking on a little farther he saw james son of zebedee and john his brother they were in the boat mending the nets
he called them and they left their father zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and they followed him 
then they came into capernaum and on the sabbath jesus went into the synagogue and taught
they were astonished at his teaching for he was teaching them as someone who has authority and not as the scribes 
just then a man in their synagogue who had an unclean spirit cried out
saying what do we have to do with you jesus of nazareth have you come to destroy us i know who you are you are the holy one of god
jesus rebuked the demon and said be quiet and come out of him
the unclean spirit threw him into convulsions and went out from him while crying out with a loud voice 
all the people were amazed so they asked each other what is this a new teaching with authority he even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him
the news about him went out everywhere into the whole region of galilee 
after coming out of the synagogue they came into the house of simon and andrew along with james and john
now simons motherinlaw was lying sick with a fever and they told jesus about her
so he came took her by the hand and raised her up the fever left her and she started serving them 
that evening after the sun had set they brought to him all who were sick or possessed by demons
the whole city gathered together at the door
he healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons but he did not allow the demons to speak because they knew him 
he got up very early while it was still dark he left and went out into a solitary place and there he prayed
simon and those who were with him searched for him
they found him and they said to him everyone is looking for you 
he said let us go elsewhere out into the surrounding towns so that i may preach there also that is why i came out here
he went throughout all of galilee preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons 
a leper came to him he was begging him he knelt down and said to him if you are willing you can make me clean
moved with compassion jesus reached out his hand and touched him saying to him i am willing be clean
immediately the leprosy left him and he was made clean 
jesus strictly warned him and sent him away
he said to him be sure to say nothing to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what moses commanded as a testimony to them 
but he went out and began to declare it freely and spread the word so much so that jesus could no longer enter a town openly but he stayed out in remote places yet people were still coming to him from everywhere  
when jesus came back to capernaum after a few days it was heard that he was at home
so many gathered there that there was no more space not even at the door and he spoke the word to them 
then some men came to him who were bringing a paralyzed man four people were carrying him
when they could not get near him because of the crowd they removed the roof that was above jesus and after they made an opening they lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on 
seeing their faith jesus said to the paralyzed man son your sins are forgiven
now some of the scribes were sitting there and they reasoned in their hearts
how can this man speak this way he blasphemes who can forgive sins but god alone 
immediately jesus knew in his spirit what they were thinking within themselves he said to them why are you thinking this in your hearts
which is easier to say to the paralyzed man your sins are forgiven or to say get up take up your mat and walk 
but in order that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins he said to the paralytic
i say to you get up take up your mat and go to your house
he got up and immediately took up the mat and went out of the house in front of everyone so that they were all amazed and they gave glory to god and they said we never saw anything like this 
he went out again by the lake and all the crowd came to him and he taught them
as he passed by he saw levi son of alphaeus sitting at the tax collectors tent and he said to him follow me he got up and followed him 
jesus was having a meal in levis house and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with him and his disciples for there were many and they followed him
when the scribes who were pharisees saw that jesus was eating with sinners and tax collectors they said to his disciples why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners 
when jesus heard this he said to them people who are strong in body do not need a physician only people who are sick need one i did not come to call righteous people but sinners 
now johns disciples and the pharisees were fasting some people came and said to him why do johns disciples and the disciples of the pharisees fast but your disciples do not fast
jesus said to them can the wedding attendants fast while the bridegroom is still with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast 
but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and in those days they will fast
no one sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment otherwise the patch tears away from it the new from the old and there is a worse tear 
no one puts new wine into old wineskins otherwise the wine will burst the skins and both the wine and the wineskins are lost instead new wine is put into fresh wineskins 
on the sabbath day jesus went through some grainfields and his disciples began picking heads of grain as they made their way
the pharisees said to him look why are they doing something that is not lawful on the sabbath day 
he said to them have you never read what david did when he was in need and hungryhe and the men who were with him
how he went into the house of god when abiathar was high priest and ate the bread of the presence which is unlawful for anyone to eat except the priests and he even gave some to those who were with him 
jesus said the sabbath was made for mankind not mankind for the sabbath
therefore the son of man is lord even of the sabbath  
again jesus walked into the synagogue and there was a man with a withered hand
some people watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the sabbath so that they could accuse him 
jesus said to the man with the withered hand get up and stand here in the middle of everyone
then he said to the people is it lawful to do good on the sabbath day or to do harm to save a life or to kill but they were silent 
he looked around at them with anger and he was grieved by their hardness of heart and he said to the man stretch out your hand he stretched it out and his hand was restored
the pharisees went out and immediately began to plot with the herodians as to how they might put him to death 
then jesus with his disciples went to the sea and a great crowd of people followed from galilee and from judea
and from jerusalem and from idumea and beyond the jordan and around tyre and sidon when they heard about the things he was doing a great crowd came to him 
he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him because of the crowd so that they would not press against him
for he healed many so that everyone who had afflictions eagerly approached him in order to touch him 
whenever the unclean spirits saw him they fell down before him and cried out and they said you are the son of god
he strictly ordered them not to make him known 
he went up on the mountain and he called for those he wanted and they came to him
he appointed the twelve whom he named apostles so that they might be with him and he might send them to proclaim the message
and to have authority to cast out demons
he appointed the twelve simon to whom he gave the name peter 
james son of zebedee and john the brother of james to whom he gave the name boanerges that is sons of thunder
and andrew philip bartholomew matthew thomas james son of alphaeus thaddaeus simon the zealot
and judas iscariot who would betray him 
then he went home and the crowd came together again so that they could not even eat bread
when his family heard about it they went out to seize him for they said he is out of his mind
the scribes who came down from jerusalem said he is possessed by beelzebul and by the ruler of the demons he drives out demons 
jesus called them to himself and said to them in parables how can satan cast out satan
if a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand
if a house is divided against itself that house will not be able to stand 
if satan has risen up against himself and is divided he is not able to stand but has come to an end
but no one can enter into the house of a strong man and steal his belongings without tying up the strong man first and then he will plunder his house 
truly i say to you all sins of the sons of men will be forgiven even all the blasphemies which they utter
but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will never have forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin
jesus said this because they were saying he has an unclean spirit 
then his mother and his brothers came and stood outside they sent for him summoning him
a crowd was sitting around him and they said to him your mother and your brothers and your sisters are outside and they are looking for you 
he answered them who are my mother and my brothers
he looked around at those who were sitting in a circle around him and said see here are my mother and my brothers
for whoever does the will of god that person is my brother and sister and mother  
again he began to teach beside the sea and a large crowd gathered around him he stepped into a boat that was on the sea and he sat down in it the whole crowd was on the shore beside the sea
he taught them many things in parables and in his teaching this is what he said to them 
listen a farmer went out to sow his seed
as he sowed some seed fell beside the road and the birds came and devoured it
other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil immediately it sprang up because it did not have deep soil 
but when the sun rose the plants were scorched and because they had no root they dried up
other seed fell among the thorn plants the thorn plants grew up and choked it and it did not produce a crop 
other seed fell into good soil and it produced a crop growing up and increasing and yielding thirty sixty and even a hundred times
then he said whoever has ears to hear let him hear 
when jesus was alone those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables
he said to them to you is given the mystery of the kingdom of god but to those outside everything is in parables
so that when they look  yes they look  but do not see and so that when they hear  yes they hear  but do not understand or else they would turn  and god would forgive them 
he said to them do you not understand this parable how then will you understand all the parables
the sower sows the word
these are the ones beside the road where the word is sown when they hear satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them 
and these are the seed sown on the rocky ground who when they hear the word immediately receive it with joy
but they do not have root in themselves but they endure for a while afterward when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word they immediately fall away 
still others are the ones sown among the thorns they are those who hear the word
but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word and it is unproductive
those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word accept it and bear fruit thirty sixty or even a hundred times as much 
jesus said to them do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket or under the bed you bring it in and you put it on a lampstand
for nothing is hidden that will not be known and nothing is secret that will not come out into the open
if anyone has ears to hear let him hear 
he said to them pay attention to what you hear for the measure you use will be measured to you and more will be added to you
because whoever has to him will be given more and whoever does not have even what he has will be taken 
he also said the kingdom of god is like a man who sows his seed on the ground
he sleeps at night and gets up by day and the seed sprouts and grows though he does not know how
the earth bears grain by itself first the blade then the ear then the mature grain in the ear
when the crop is ripe he immediately sends in the sickle because the harvest has come 
again he said to what can we compare the kingdom of god or what parable can we use to explain it
it is like a mustard seed which when it is sown is the smallest of all the seeds on earth
yet when it is sown it grows and becomes greater than all the garden plants and it forms large branches so that the birds of heaven can make their nests in its shade 
with many parables like this he spoke the word to them as much as they were able to understand
and he did not speak to them without a parable but when he was alone he explained everything to his own disciples 
on that day when evening had come he said to them let us go over to the other side
so they left the crowd taking jesus with them just as he was in the boat there were other boats going along with him
just then a violent windstorm arose and the waves were breaking into the boat so that the boat was almost full of water 
but jesus himself was in the stern asleep on a cushion they woke him up saying teacher do you not care that we are about to die
he got up rebuked the wind and said to the sea peace be still then the wind ceased and there was a great calm 
then he said to them why are you afraid do you still not have faith
they were filled with great fear and said to one another who then is this because even the wind and the sea obey him  
they came to the other side of the sea to the region of the gerasenes
when jesus was getting out of the boat a man with an unclean spirit came up to him out of the tombs 
the man lived in the tombs no one could restrain him anymore not even with a chain
he had been bound many times with shackles and with chains he tore the chains apart and his shackles were shattered no one had the strength to subdue him 
every night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he cried out and cut himself with sharp stones
when he saw jesus from a distance he ran to him and bowed down before him 
he cried out with a loud voice what do i have to do with you jesus son of the most high god i beg you by god himself do not torment me
for he had been saying to him come out of the man you unclean spirit 
he asked him what is your name he answered him my name is legion for we are many
he begged him again and again not to send them out of the region 
now a great herd of pigs was there feeding on the hill
and they begged him saying send us into the pigs let us enter into them
so he allowed them the unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs and the herd rushed down the steep hill into the sea and about two thousand pigs drowned in the sea 
then those who were feeding the pigs ran away and reported what had happened in the city and in the countryside and so people went out to see what had happened
then they came to jesus and they saw the demonpossessed man the one who had been possessed by legion sitting there clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid 
those who had seen what happened to the demonpossessed man told them about it in detail and they also told them about the pigs
then they started to beg him to leave their region 
when he was getting into the boat the demonpossessed man begged him that he might be with him
but jesus did not permit him but said to him go to your house and to your people and tell them what the lord has done for you and how he has shown you mercy
so he went away and began to proclaim in the decapolis the great things that jesus had done for him and everyone was amazed 
now when jesus had crossed over again to the other side in the boat a great crowd gathered around him as he was beside the sea
then one of the leaders of the synagogue named jairus came and when he saw him fell at his feet
he begged again and again saying my little daughter is near death i beg you come and lay your hands on her that she may be made well and live
so he went with him and a great crowd followed him and pressed close around him 
now a woman was there who had a flow of blood for twelve years
she had suffered much from many doctors and had spent everything that she had but instead of getting better she grew worse
when she had heard the reports about jesus she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak 
for she said if i touch just his clothes i will be healed
when she touched him the bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was healed from her affliction 
jesus immediately realized in himself that power had gone out from him he turned around in the crowd and said who touched my clothes
his disciples said to him you see this crowd pressed around you and you say who touched me
but jesus looked around to see who had done it 
the woman knowing what had happened to her feared and trembled she came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth
he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace and be healed from your affliction 
while he was speaking some people came from the synagogue leaders house saying your daughter is dead why trouble the teacher any longer 
but when jesus overheard the message that was spoken he said to the leader of the synagogue do not be afraid just believe
he did not permit anyone to accompany him except peter james and john the brother of james
they came to the house of the leader of the synagogue and he saw there people making a lot of noise they were weeping and wailing loudly 
when he entered the house he said to them why are you upset and why do you weep the child is not dead but sleeps
they began to mock him but he put them all outside and took the father of the child and the mother and those who were with him and he went in where the child was 
he took the hand of the child and said to her talitha koum which is translated little girl i say to you get up
immediately the child got up and walked for she was twelve years of age they were immediately astonished with overwhelming amazement
he strictly ordered them that no one should know about this then he told them to give her something to eat  
he went out from there and came to his hometown and his disciples followed him
when the sabbath came he taught in the synagogue many people heard him and they were amazed they said where did he get these teachings what is this wisdom that has been given to him what are these miracles that he does with his hands
is this not the carpenter the son of mary and the brother of james and joses and judas and simon are his sisters not here with us they were offended by jesus  the man called joses here is called joseph in matthew  the name joseph represents how the name was spelled in hebrew and the name joses represents how his name was spelled in greek 
then jesus said to them a prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and among his own relatives and in his own household
he could not do any mighty work except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them
he was amazed at their unbelief then he went around the villages teaching 
then he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits
and instructed them to take nothing for their journey except a staffno bread no bag and no money in their belts
but to wear sandals and not to wear two tunics 
he said to them whenever you enter a house remain until you go away from there
if any town will not receive you or listen to you when you leave that place shake the dust off your feet as a testimony to them 
they went out and proclaimed that people should repent
they cast out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them 
king herod heard this for jesus name had become well known some were saying john the baptist has been raised from the dead and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him
some others said he is elijah still others said he is a prophet like one of the prophets in ancient times 
but when herod heard this he said john whom i beheaded has been raised
for herod sent to have john arrested and he had him bound in prison on account of herodias his brother philips wife because he had married her 
for john told herod it is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife
but herodias held on to anger against him and wanted to kill him but she could not
for herod feared john he knew that he was a righteous and holy man and he kept him safe listening to him made him greatly perplexed yet he heard him gladly 
then an opportunity came when herod had his birthday and he made a dinner for his officials and for the commanders and leaders of galilee
the daughter of herodias herself came in and danced for them and she pleased herod and his dinner guests the king said to the girl ask me for anything you want and i will give it to you 
he swore to her saying whatever you ask of me i will give you up to half of my kingdom
she went out and said to her mother what should i ask him for she said the head of john the baptist
she immediately hurried back to the king and she asked saying i want you to give me right now the head of john the baptist on a wooden platter 
though this deeply grieved the king he could not refuse her request because of the oath he had made and because of his dinner guests
so the king sent a soldier from his guard and commanded him to bring him johns head the guard went and beheaded him in the prison
he brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl and the girl gave it to her mother
when his disciples heard of this they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb 
the apostles came together with jesus and told him all that they had done and taught
then he said to them come away by yourselves into a deserted place and rest a while for many were coming and going and they did not even have time to eat
so they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves 
but they saw them leaving and many recognized them and they ran there together on foot from all the towns and they arrived there before them
when they came ashore he saw a great crowd and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd so he began to teach them many things 
when the hour was late his disciples came to him and said this is a deserted place and the hour is already late
send them away so that they may go into the nearby countryside and villages to buy something to eat for themselves 
but he answered and said to them you give them something to eat they said to him can we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat
he said to them how many loaves do you have go and see when they found out they said five loaves and two fish 
he commanded all the people to sit down in groups upon the green grass
they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties
he took the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people he also divided the two fish among them all 
they all ate until they were satisfied
they took up broken pieces of bread twelve baskets full and also pieces of the fish
there were five thousand men who ate the loaves 
immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side to bethsaida while he sent the crowd away
after taking leave of them he went up the mountain to pray
evening came and the boat was now in the middle of the sea and he was alone on land 
he saw that they were straining against the oars for the wind was against them about the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea and he wanted to pass by them
but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought he was a ghost and cried out
because they saw him and were troubled immediately he spoke to them and said to them be courageous it is i do not be afraid 
he got into the boat with them and the wind ceased blowing they were completely amazed
for they had not understood what the loaves meant instead their hearts were hardened 
when they had crossed over they came to land at gennesaret and anchored the boat
when they came out of the boat the people recognized him immediately
and they ran throughout the whole region and began to bring the sick on their mats to wherever they heard he was 
wherever he entered into villages or cities or into the country they would put the sick in the marketplaces they begged him to let them touch the edge of his garment and as many as touched him were healed  
the pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from jerusalem gathered around him 
they saw that some of his disciples ate bread with hands that were unclean that is unwashed
for the pharisees and all the jews do not eat unless they wash their hands carefully because they hold to the tradition of the elders
when the pharisees come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they bathe themselves and they hold to many other things they have received such as the washing of cups pots copper vessels and the couches upon which they eat 
the pharisees and the scribes asked jesus why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders but eat their bread with unclean hands 
but he said to them isaiah prophesied well about you hypocrites as it is written this people honors me with their lips  but their heart is far from me
in vain they worship me  teaching the commands of men as their doctrines 
you abandon the commandment of god and hold on to the tradition of men
he also said to them how well you reject the commandment of god so you may keep your tradition
for moses said honor your father and your mother and he who speaks evil of his father or mother will surely be put to death 
but you say if a man says to his father or mother whatever help you would have received from me is corban that is to say a gift
then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother
you are making the word of god void by your tradition which you have handed down and many similar things you do 
he called the crowd again and said to them listen to me all of you and understand
there is nothing from outside of a person that can defile him when it enters into him it is what comes out of the person that defiles him
 the best ancient copies do not have verse  if any man has ears to hear let him hear  
now when jesus left the crowd and entered the house his disciples asked him about the parable
jesus said are you also still without understanding do you not know that whatever enters into a person from outside cannot defile him
because it cannot go into his heart but it goes into his stomach and then passes out into the latrine with this statement jesus declared all foods clean 
he said it is that which comes out of the person that defiles him
for from within a person out of the heart proceed evil thoughts sexual immorality theft murder
adultery coveting wickedness deceit sensuality envy slander pride folly
all these evils come from within and they are what defile a person 
he got up from there and went away to the region of tyre and sidon there he went into a house and he wanted no one to know where he was yet he could not be hidden
but immediately  some ancient copies do not have the words but immediately  a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and fell down at his feet
now the woman was a greek a syrophoenician by descent she begged him to cast out the demon from her daughter 
he said to her let the children first be fed for it is not proper to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs
but she answered and said to him yes lord even the dogs under the table eat the childrens crumbs 
he said to her because of what you have said you are free to go the demon has gone out of your daughter
she went back to her house and found the child lying on the bed and the demon was gone 
then he went out again from the region of tyre and went through sidon to the sea of galilee up into the region of the decapolis
they brought to him someone who was deaf and had difficulty speaking and they begged him to lay his hand on him 
then taking him aside away from the crowd privately he put his fingers into his ears and then he spit and touched his tongue
then he looked up to heaven sighed and said to him ephphatha that is to say open
at once his ears were opened the bond of his tongue was released and he began to speak plainly 
jesus ordered them to tell no one but the more he ordered them the more abundantly they proclaimed it
they were extremely astonished saying he has done all things well he even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak  
in those days there was again a great crowd and they had nothing to eat jesus called his disciples and said to them
i have compassion on the crowd because they continue to be with me already for three days and have nothing to eat
if i send them away to their home without eating they may faint on the way some of them have come a long way
his disciples answered him where can we get enough loaves of bread in such a deserted place to satisfy these people 
he asked them how many loaves do you have they said seven
he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground he took the seven loaves gave thanks and broke them he gave them to his disciples to set before them and they set them before the crowd 
they also had a few small fish and after he gave thanks for them he commanded the disciples to serve these as well
they ate and were satisfied and they picked up the remaining broken pieces seven large baskets
there were about four thousand people then he sent them away
immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and they went into the region of dalmanutha 
then the pharisees came out and began to argue with him they sought from him a sign from heaven to test him
he sighed deeply in his spirit and said why does this generation seek for a sign truly i say to you no sign will be given to this generation
then he left them got into a boat again and went away to the other side 
now the disciples had forgotten to take bread with them they had no more than one loaf of bread in the boat
he instructed them saying keep watch and be on guard against the yeast of the pharisees and the yeast of herod 
the disciples were arguing with one another about having no bread
when he understood this he asked them why are you arguing about having no bread do you still not see or understand do you have hardened hearts 
you have eyes do you not see you have ears do you not hear do you not remember
when i broke the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces of bread did you take up they said to him twelve 
when i broke the seven loaves among the four thousand how many basketfuls of broken pieces of bread did you take up they said to him seven
he said do you not yet understand 
they came to bethsaida the people there brought to him a blind man and begged jesus to touch him
jesus took hold of the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him he asked him do you see anything 
he looked up and said i see men who look like walking trees
then he again laid his hands upon his eyes and the man opened his eyes his sight was restored and he saw all things clearly
jesus sent him away to his home and said do not enter the village 
jesus went out with his disciples into the villages of caesarea philippi on the way he asked his disciples who do the people say that i am
they answered him and said john the baptist others say elijah and others one of the prophets 
he asked them but who do you say that i am peter said to him you are the christ
jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him 
he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and would be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and would be killed and after three days rise up
he spoke that message openly then peter took him aside and began to rebuke him 
but jesus turned and looked at his disciples and then he rebuked peter and said get behind me satan you are not setting your mind on the things of god but on the things of people
then he called the crowd and his disciples together and he said to them if anyone wants to follow me he must deny himself take up his cross and follow me 
for whoever wants to save his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake and for the gospel will save it
what does it profit a person to gain the whole world and then forfeit his life
what can a person give in exchange for his life 
whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the son of man will be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels  
he said to them truly i say to you there are some of you who are standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of god come with power
six days later jesus took peter and james and john with him up a high mountain alone by themselves then he was transfigured before them
his garments became radiantly brilliant extremely white whiter than any bleacher on earth could bleach them 
then elijah with moses appeared to them and they were talking with jesus
peter answered and said to jesus rabbi it is good for us to be here and so let us make three shelters one for you one for moses and one for elijah
for he did not know what to say for they were terrified 
a cloud came and overshadowed them then a voice came out of the cloud this is my beloved son listen to him
suddenly when they looked around they no longer saw anyone with them but only jesus 
as they were coming down the mountain he commanded them to tell no one what they had seen until the son of man had risen from the dead
so they kept the matter to themselves but they discussed among themselves what rising from the dead could mean 
they asked him why do the scribes say that elijah must come first
he said to them elijah does come first to restore all things why then is it written that the son of man must suffer many things and be despised
but i say to you that elijah has come and they did whatever they wanted to him just as it is written about him 
when they came to the disciples they saw a great crowd around them and scribes were arguing with them
as soon as they saw jesus the whole crowd was amazed and as they ran up to him they greeted him
he asked his disciples what are you arguing with them about 
someone in the crowd answered him teacher i brought my son to you he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak
it seizes him and it throws him down and he foams at the mouth grinds his teeth and becomes rigid i asked your disciples to drive it out of him but they could not
he answered them unbelieving generation how long will i have to stay with you how long will i bear with you bring him to me 
they brought the boy to him when the spirit saw jesus it immediately threw him into a convulsion the boy fell on the ground and foamed at the mouth
jesus asked his father for how much time has he been like this the father said since childhood
it has often thrown him into the fire or into the waters and tried to destroy him if you are able to do anything have pity on us and help us 
jesus said to him if you are able all things are possible for the one who believes
immediately the father of the child cried out and said i believe help my unbelief
when jesus saw the crowd running to them he rebuked the unclean spirit and said you mute and deaf spirit i command you come out of him and never enter into him again 
it cried out and convulsed the boy greatly and then came out the boy looked like one who was dead so that many said he is dead
but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and the boy stood up 
when jesus came into the house his disciples asked him privately why could we not cast it out
he said to them this kind cannot be cast out except by prayer 
they went out from there and passed through galilee he did not want anyone to know where they were
for he was teaching his disciples he said to them the son of man will be given over into the hands of men and they will put him to death when he has been put to death after three days he will rise again
but they did not understand this statement and they were afraid to ask him 
then they came to capernaum after he entered the house he asked them what were you discussing on the way
but they were silent for they had been arguing with one another on the way about who was the greatest
sitting down he called the twelve together and he said to them if anyone wants to be first he must be last of all and servant of all 
he took a little child and placed him in their midst he took him in his arms and said to them
whoever receives such a child in my name receives me whoever receives me does not receive me but the one who sent me 
john said to him teacher we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we stopped him because he does not follow us
but jesus said do not stop him for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name and can soon afterwards say anything bad about me 
whoever is not against us is for us
whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to christ truly i say to you he will not lose his reward 
whoever causes one of these little ones who believes in me to stumble it would be better for him to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea
if your hand causes you to stumble cut it off it is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands and to go into hell into the unquenchable fire
 the best ancient copies do not have this phrase and verse  is not included in the ulb where their worm does not die and the fire is not put out this phrase does appear in verse  
if your foot causes you to stumble cut it off it is better for you to enter into life lame than to have your two feet and be thrown into hell
 the best ancient copies do not have this phrase and verse  is not included in the ulb where their worm does not die and the fire is not put out this phrase does appear in verse  
if your eye causes you to stumble tear it out it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into hell
where their worm does not die and the fire is not put out 
for everyone will be salted with fire
salt is good but if the salt has lost its saltiness how can you make it salty again have salt among yourselves and be at peace with one another  
jesus left that place and went to the region of judea and to the area beyond the jordan river and the crowds came to him again he was teaching them again as he was accustomed to do
then pharisees came to him to test him and asked is it lawful for a husband to divorce his wife
he answered what did moses command you
they said moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and then to send her away 
it was because of your hard hearts that he wrote you this law jesus said to them
but from the beginning of creation god made them male and female 
for this reason  a man will leave his father and mother  and be united to his wife
and the two will become one flesh so they are no longer two but one flesh
therefore what god has joined together let no man tear apart 
when they were in the house the disciples asked him again about this
he said to them whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her
if she divorces her husband and marries another man she commits adultery 
then they brought their little children to him so that he might touch them but the disciples rebuked them
but when jesus noticed it he was angry and said to them permit the little children to come to me and do not forbid them for the kingdom of god belongs to those who are like them 
truly i say to you whoever will not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will definitely not enter it
then he took the children into his arms and blessed them as he placed his hands on them 
when he began his journey a man ran up to him and knelt before him and asked good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life
jesus said why do you call me good no one is good except god alone
you know the commandments do not murder do not commit adultery do not steal do not testify falsely do not defraud honor your father and mother 
the man said teacher all these things i have obeyed from the time i was a youth
jesus looked at him and loved him he said to him one thing you lack you must sell all that you have and give it to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me
but because of this statement he looked very sad and he went away sorrowful because he had many possessions 
jesus looked around and said to his disciples how difficult it is for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of god
the disciples were astonished at his words but jesus said to them again children how hard it is to enter into the kingdom of god
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of god 
they were greatly astonished and said to each other then who can be saved
jesus looked at them and said with people it is impossible but not with god for all things are possible with god
peter began to speak to him look we have left everything and have followed you 
jesus said truly i say to you there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for my sake and for the gospel
who will not receive a hundred times as much now in this age houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life
but many who are first will be last and the last first 
they were on the road going up to jerusalem and jesus was going ahead of them the disciples were amazed and those who were following behind were afraid then jesus took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what would soon happen to him
see we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be given over to the chief priests and the scribes they will condemn him to death and give him over to the gentiles
they will mock him spit on him whip him and put him to death but after three days he will rise 
james and john the sons of zebedee came up to him and said teacher we want you to do for us whatever we ask you
he said to them what do you want me to do for you
they said allow us to sit with you in your glory one at your right hand and the other at your left 
but jesus replied to them you do not know what you are asking are you able to drink the cup which i will drink or be baptized with the baptism with which i will be baptized
they said to him we are able jesus said to them the cup that i will drink you will drink and with the baptism with which i am baptized you also will be baptized
but who is to sit at my right hand or at my left hand is not mine to give but it is for those for whom it has been prepared 
when the other ten disciples heard about this they began to be very angry with james and john
jesus called them to himself and said you know those who are considered rulers of the gentiles dominate them and their high officials exercise authority over them 
but it is not this way among you whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant
and whoever wishes to be first among you must be the slave of all
for the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many 
they came to jericho as he left jericho with his disciples and a great crowd the son of timaeus bartimaeus a blind beggar sat by the road
when he heard that it was jesus the nazarene he began to shout and to say jesus son of david have mercy on me
many rebuked the blind man telling him to be quiet but he cried out all the more son of david have mercy on me 
jesus stopped and commanded him to be called they called the blind man saying be brave get up he is calling for you
he threw aside his coat sprang up and came to jesus 
jesus answered him and said what do you want me to do for you the blind man said rabboni i want to receive my sight
then jesus said to him go your faith has healed you immediately he could see again and he followed him on the road  
now as they came to jerusalem they were close to bethphage and bethany at the mount of olives and jesus sent out two of his disciples
and said to them go into the village opposite us as soon as you enter it you will find a colt that has never been ridden untie it and bring it to me
if anyone says to you why are you doing this you should say the lord has need of it and will immediately send it back here 
they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street and they untied it
some people were standing there and said to them what are you doing untying that colt
they spoke to them as jesus told them and the people let them go their way 
they brought the colt to jesus and threw their cloaks on it and he sat on it
many people spread their garments on the road and others spread branches they had cut from the fields
those who went before him and those who followed shouted hosanna blessed is the one  who comes in the name of the lord
blessed is the coming kingdom of our father david  hosanna in the highest 
then jesus entered into jerusalem and went into the temple and looked around at everything now the time being late he went out to bethany with the twelve
the next day while they were going out from bethany he was hungry 
seeing from far away a fig tree that had leaves he went to see if he could find any fruit on it and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for figs
he said to it no one will ever eat fruit from you again and his disciples heard it 
they came to jerusalem and he entered the temple and began to cast out the sellers and the buyers in the temple he turned over the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons
he did not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple that could be sold 
he taught them and said is it not written my house will be called  a house of prayer for all the nations but you have made it a den of robbers
the chief priests and the scribes heard what he had said and they looked for a way to destroy him for they feared him because the entire crowd was amazed at his teaching
when evening came they left the city 
as they walked by in the morning they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots
peter remembered and said rabbi look the fig tree you cursed has withered away 
jesus answered them have faith in god
truly i say to you that if anyone says to this mountain get up and cast yourself into the sea and if he does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he said will happen that is what god will do 
therefore i say to you everything you pray and ask for believe that you have received it and it will be yours
when you stand and pray you must forgive whatever you have against anyone so that your father who is in heaven will also forgive you your trespasses
 the best ancient copies of mark do not have this sentence but if you do not forgive neither will your father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses  
they came to jerusalem again as jesus was walking in the temple the chief priests the scribes and the elders came to him
they said to him by what authority do you do these things and who gave you the authority to do them 
jesus said to them i will ask you one question tell me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things
the baptism of johnwas it from heaven or from men answer me 
they discussed between themselves and argued and said if we say from heaven he will say why then did you not believe him
but if we say from men   they were afraid of the people for everyone was convinced that john was a prophet
then they answered jesus and said we do not know then jesus said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i do these things  
then jesus began to teach them in parables he said a man planted a vineyard put a hedge around it and dug a pit for a winepress he built a watchtower and then leased the vineyard to vine growers then he went away on a journey
at the right time he sent a servant to the vine growers to receive from them some of the fruit of the vineyard
but they took him beat him and sent him away emptyhanded 
again he sent to them another servant and they wounded him in the head and treated him shamefully
he sent yet another and this one they killed they treated many others in the same way beating some and killing others 
he had still one more person to send a beloved son he was the last one he sent to them he said they will respect my son
but the vine growers said to one another this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours 
they seized him killed him and threw him out of the vineyard
therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do he will come and destroy the vine growers and will give the vineyard to others 
have you not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected  has been made the cornerstone
this was from the lord  and it is marvelous in our eyes
after this the jewish leaders sought a way to arrest jesus because they understood that he spoke the parable against them but they were afraid of the crowd so they left him and went away 
then they sent some of the pharisees and the herodians to him to trap him with words
when they came they said to him teacher what people think is not a concern to you because you do not show partiality to anyone you truly teach the way of god is it lawful to pay taxes to caesar or not should we pay or not
but jesus knew their hypocrisy and said to them why do you test me bring me a denarius so i can look at it 
they brought one to jesus he said to them whose likeness and inscription is this they said caesars
jesus said give to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods they marveled at him 
then sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him they asked him saying
teacher moses wrote for us if a mans brother dies and leaves a wife behind him but had no child the man should take the brothers wife and raise up children for his brother 
there were seven brothers the first took a wife and then died having no children
then the second took her and died leaving no child and the third in the same way
the seven left no children last of all the woman also died
in the resurrection when they rise again whose wife will she be for all seven brothers had her as their wife 
jesus said is this not the reason you are mistaken because you do not know the scriptures nor the power of god
for when they rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but they are like angels in heaven 
but concerning the dead that are raised have you not read in the book of moses in the account about the bush how god spoke to him and said i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob
he is not the god of the dead but of the living you are quite mistaken 
one of the scribes came and heard their discussion he saw that jesus answered them well he asked him what commandment is the most important of all
jesus answered the most important is hear israel the lord our god the lord is one
you must love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind and with all your strength
the second commandment is this you must love your neighbor as yourself there is no other greater commandment than these 
the scribe said good teacher you have truly said that god is one and that there is no other besides him
to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love ones neighbor as oneself is even more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices
when jesus saw that he had given a wise answer he said to him you are not far from the kingdom of god after that no one dared to ask jesus any more questions 
while jesus was teaching in the temple courts he said how is it that the scribes say the christ is the son of david
david himself in the holy spirit said the lord said to my lord  sit at my right hand  until i put your enemies under your feet
david himself calls him lord so how can the christ be davids son the large crowd gladly listened to him 
in his teaching jesus said beware of the scribes who like to walk in long robes and be greeted in the marketplaces
and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts
they also devour widows houses and they pray long prayers for people to see these men will receive greater condemnation 
then jesus sat down across from an offering box in the temple area he was watching people as they dropped their money into the box many rich people put in large amounts of money
then a poor widow came and put in two mites worth about a penny 
he called his disciples and said to them truly i say to you this poor widow has put in more than all of them who contributed to the offering box
for all of them gave out of their abundance but this widow out of her poverty put in all of the money which she had to live on  
as jesus was walking away from the temple one of his disciples said to him teacher look at the wonderful stones and wonderful buildings
jesus said to him do you see these great buildings not one stone will be left on another which will not be torn down 
as he sat on the mount of olives opposite the temple peter james john and andrew asked him privately
tell us when will these things happen what will be the sign when all these things are about to happen 
jesus began to say to them be careful that no one leads you astray
many will come in my name and say i am he and they will lead many astray 
when you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be frightened these things must happen but the end is not yet
for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be earthquakes in many places and famines these are the beginnings of birth pains 
be on your guard they will give you over to councils and you will be beaten in synagogues you will stand before both governors and kings for my sake as a testimony to them
but the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations 
when they arrest you and hand you over do not worry about what you should say for in that hour what you should say will be given to you it will not be you who speak but the holy spirit
brother will deliver up brother to death and a father his child children will rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death
you will be hated by everyone because of my name but whoever endures to the end that person will be saved 
when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be standing let the reader understand let those who are in judea flee to the mountains
let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house or take anything out of it
and let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak 
but woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days
pray that it might not occur in the winter
for those will be days of great tribulation such as has not been from the beginning of creation which god created until now no nor ever will be again
unless the lord had shortened the days no flesh would be saved but for the sake of the elect those whom he chose he cut short the days 
then if anyone says to you look here is the christ or look there he is do not believe it
for false christs and false prophets will appear and will give signs and wonders so as to deceive if possible even the elect
be on guard i have told you all these things ahead of time 
but after the tribulation of those days  the sun will be darkened  the moon will not give its light
the stars will fall from the sky  and the powers that are in the heavens  will be shaken
then they will see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory
then he will send his angels and he will gather together his elect from the four winds from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky 
learn a lesson from the fig tree as soon as the branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves you know that summer is near
so also when you see these things happening recognize that he is near close to the gates 
truly i say to you this generation will not pass away until all of these things occur
heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away
but concerning that day or that hour no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the son but the father 
be alert watch because you do not know what time it is  some ancient copies of the greek text read be alert watch and pray 
it is like a man who goes on a journeyhe leaves his house and puts his servants in charge of the house each one with his work and he commands the doorkeeper to stay alert 
therefore stay alert because you do not know when the master of the house will come home it could be in the evening at midnight when the rooster crows or in the morning
if he comes suddenly do not let him find you sleeping
what i say to you i say to everyone watch  
it was now two days before the passover and the festival of unleavened bread the chief priests and the scribes were seeking ways to stealthily arrest jesus and then kill him
for they were saying not during the festival so that a riot does not arise among the people 
while jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper as he was reclining at the table a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume which was pure nard she broke the jar and poured the nard on his head
but there were some who were angry they spoke among themselves and said what is the reason for the waste of this perfume
this perfume could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor then they scolded her 
but jesus said leave her alone why are you troubling her she has done a beautiful thing for me
you always have the poor with you and whenever you desire you can do good to them but you will not always have me
she has done what she could she has anointed my body for burial
truly i say to you wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world what this woman has done will be spoken of in memory of her 
then judas iscariot one of the twelve went away to the chief priests so that he might give him over to them
when the chief priests heard it they were glad and promised to give him money he began looking for an opportunity to give him over to them 
on the first day of unleavened bread when they sacrificed the passover lamb his disciples said to him where do you want us to go to prepare so you may eat the passover meal
he sent two of his disciples and said to them go into the city and a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you follow him
where he enters a house follow him in and say to the owner of that house the teacher says where is my guest room where i will eat the passover with my disciples 
he will show you a large furnished upper room that is ready make the preparations for us there
the disciples left and went to the city they found everything as he had said to them and they prepared the passover meal 
when it was evening he came with the twelve
as they were lying down at the table and eating jesus said truly i say to you one of you eating with me will betray me
they were all very sorrowful and one by one they said to him surely not i 
jesus answered and said to them it is one of the twelve the one now dipping bread with me in the bowl
for the son of man will go as it is written about him but woe to that man through whom the son of man is betrayed it would have been better for him if he had not been born 
as they were eating jesus took bread blessed it and broke it he gave it to them and said take this this is my body
he took a cup gave thanks and gave it to them and they all drank from it
he said to them this is my blood of the covenant the blood that is poured out for many
truly i say to you i will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new in the kingdom of god 
when they had sung a hymn they went out to the mount of olives
jesus said to them all of you will fall away for it is written i will strike the shepherd  and the sheep will be scattered 
but after i am raised up i will go ahead of you into galilee
peter said to him even if all fall away i will not 
jesus said to him truly i say to you todayyes this very nightbefore the rooster crows twice you will deny me three times
but peter said emphatically if i must die with you i will not deny you they all made the same promise 
they came to the place called gethsemane and jesus said to his disciples sit here while i pray
he took peter james and john with him and began to be distressed and deeply troubled
he said to them my soul is deeply grieved even to the point of death remain here and watch 
going a little farther jesus fell to the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him
he said abba father all things are possible with you remove this cup from me but not my will but yours 
he came back and found them sleeping and he said to peter simon are you asleep could you not watch for one hour
watch and pray that you do not enter into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
again he went away and prayed and he used the same words 
when he came back again he found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy they did not know what to say to him
he came the third time and said to them are you still sleeping and taking your rest enough the hour has come look the son of man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners
get up let us go look the one who is betraying me is near 
while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve arrived and a large crowd was with him with swords and clubs from the chief priests the scribes and the elders
now his betrayer had given them a sign saying the one i kiss is the man seize him and lead him away under guard
when judas arrived immediately he came up to jesus and said rabbi and he kissed him
then they laid hands on him and seized him 
but one of them who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear
jesus said to them do you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to arrest me
when i was daily with you and i was teaching in the temple you did not arrest me but this was done that the scriptures might be fulfilled
all those with jesus left him and ran away 
a young man wearing only a linen garment that was wrapped around him was following jesus when the men seized him
he left the linen garment and ran away naked 
they led jesus to the high priest there were gathered with him all the chief priests the elders and the scribes
now peter followed him from a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest he sat among the officers warming himself near the fire 
now the chief priests and the entire jewish council were seeking testimony against jesus so they might put him to death but they did not find any
for many brought false testimony against him but even their testimony did not agree 
some stood up and brought false testimony against him they said
we heard him say i will destroy this temple made with hands and in three days i will build another made without hands
yet even their testimony did not agree 
the high priest stood up among them and asked jesus have you no answer what is it these men testify against you
but he was silent and answered nothing again the high priest questioned him and said are you the christ the son of the blessed one
jesus said i am and you will see the son of man  when he sits at the right hand of power  and comes with the clouds of heaven 
the high priest tore his garments and said do we still need witnesses
you have heard the blasphemy what is your decision they all condemned him as one who deserved death
some began to spit on him and to cover his face and strike him with their fists and say to him prophesy the officers took him and beat him 
while peter was below in the courtyard one of the servant girls of the high priest came to him
she saw peter warming himself and she looked closely at him and said you were also with the nazarene jesus
but he denied it saying i neither know nor understand what you are talking about then he went out into the gateway and the rooster crowed  some ancient copies do not have and the rooster crowed  
but the servant girl saw him and began to say again to those who stood there this man is one of them
but he denied it again after a little while those who stood there were saying to peter surely you are one of them for you also are a galilean 
but he began to put himself under curses and to swear i do not know this man you are talking about
the rooster immediately crowed a second time then peter remembered the words that jesus had said to him before the rooster crows twice you will deny me three times and he broke down and wept  
early in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the entire jewish council consulted together then they bound jesus and led him away they handed him over to pilate
pilate asked him are you the king of the jews he answered him you say so
the chief priests were accusing him of many things 
pilate again asked him do you give no answer see how many things they are accusing you of
but jesus no longer answered pilate and that amazed him 
now at the time of the festival pilate usually released to them one prisoner a prisoner they requested
there was a man called barabbas in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the rebellion
the crowd came to pilate and began to ask him to do for them as he had done in the past 
pilate answered them and said do you want me to release to you the king of the jews
for he knew that it was because of envy that the chief priests had handed jesus over to him
but the chief priests stirred up the crowd to cry out that barabbas should be released instead 
pilate answered them again and said what then should i do with the king of the jews
they shouted again crucify him 
pilate said to them what evil has he done but they shouted more and more crucify him
pilate wanted to satisfy the crowd so he released barabbas to them he scourged jesus and then handed him over to be crucified 
the soldiers led him inside the courtyard which is the government headquarters and they called together the whole company of soldiers
they put a purple robe on jesus and they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on him
they began to salute him and say hail king of the jews 
they were striking his head with a reed staff and spitting on him they went to their knees and they bowed down before him
when they had mocked him they took off of him the purple robe and put his own garments on him and then led him out to crucify him
a certain man simon of cyrene was coming in from the country he was the father of alexander and rufus and they forced him to carry his cross 
the soldiers brought jesus to the place called golgotha which is translated place of a skull
they offered him wine mixed with myrrh but he did not drink it
they crucified him and divided up his garments by casting lots to determine what piece each soldier would take 
it was the third hour when they crucified him
on a sign they wrote the charge against him the king of the jews
with him they crucified two robbers one on the right of him and one on his left
 the best ancient copies do not have mark  the scripture was fulfilled that says he was counted with the lawless ones 
those who passed by insulted him shaking their heads and saying aha you who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days
save yourself and come down from the cross 
in the same way the chief priests were mocking him with each other along with the scribes and said he saved others but he cannot save himself
let the christ the king of israel come down now from the cross that we may see and believe those who were crucified with him also insulted him 
at the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour
at the ninth hour jesus cried out with a loud voice eloi eloi lama sabachthani which is interpreted my god my god why have you abandoned me
some of those standing by heard his words and said look he is calling for elijah 
someone ran put sour wine on a sponge put it on a reed staff and gave it to him to drink the man said let us see if elijah comes to take him down
then jesus cried out with a loud voice and died
the curtain of the temple was split in two from the top to the bottom 
when the centurion who stood and faced jesus saw that he had died in this way he said truly this man was the son of god
there were also women who looked on from a distance among them were mary magdalene mary the mother of james the younger and of joses  the man called joses here is called joseph in mark  the name joseph represents how the name was spelled in hebrew and the name joses represents how his name was spelled in greek and salome
when he was in galilee they followed him and served him many other women also came up with him to jerusalem 
when evening had come because it was the day of preparation that is the day before the sabbath
joseph of arimathea came there he was a respected member of the council who was waiting for the kingdom of god he boldly went in to pilate and asked for the body of jesus
pilate was amazed that jesus was already dead he called the centurion and asked him if jesus was dead 
when pilate learned from the centurion that jesus was dead he gave the body to joseph
joseph had bought a linen cloth he took him down from the cross wrapped him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of a rock then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb
mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses saw the place where jesus was buried  
when the sabbath day was over mary magdalene mary the mother of james and salome bought spices that they might come and anoint jesus body
very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb when the sun had come up 
they were saying to one another who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb
when they looked up they saw that the stone had been rolled away for it was very large 
they entered the tomb and saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side and they were alarmed
he said to them do not be alarmed you seek jesus the nazarene who was crucified he is risen he is not here look at the place where they had laid him
but go tell his disciples and peter he is going ahead of you to galilee there you will see him just as he told you 
they went out and ran from the tomb they were trembling and amazed they said nothing to anyone because they were so afraid 
 the best ancient copies do not have mark  early on the first day of the week after he arose he appeared first to mary magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons
she went and told those who were with him while they were mourning and weeping
they heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her but they did not believe 
after these things he appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking out into the country
they went back and told the rest but they did not believe them 
jesus later appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they did not believe those who saw him after he rose from the dead
he said to them go into all the world and preach the gospel to the entire creation
he who believes and is baptized will be saved and he who does not believe will be condemned 
these signs will go with those who believe in my name they will cast out demons they will speak in new languages
they will pick up snakes with their hands and if they drink anything deadly it will not hurt them they will lay hands on the sick and they will get well 
after the lord jesus had spoken to them he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of god
the disciples left and preached everywhere, while the lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that went with them.  see the note on mark .
many have taken on the work of putting together an account of the things that have been accomplished among us
just as they were passed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word
so it seemed good to me also because i have accurately investigated everything from the beginning to write an orderly account for you most excellent theophilus
so that you might know the certainty of the things you have been taught 
in the days of herod king of judea there was a certain priest named zechariah from the division of abijah his wife elizabeth was also a descendant of aaron
they were both righteous before god walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the lord
but they had no child because elizabeth was barren and they were both advanced in their days 
now it came about that zechariah was in gods presence carrying out the priestly duties in the order of his division
according to the customary way of choosing which priest would serve he had been chosen by lot to enter into the temple of the lord to burn incense
the whole crowd of people was praying outside at the hour when the incense was burned 
now an angel of the lord appeared to him and stood at the right side of the incense altar
when zechariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell on him
but the angel said to him do not be afraid zechariah because your prayer has been heard your wife elizabeth will bear you a son you will call his name john 
you will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth
for he will be great in the sight of the lord he must never drink wine or strong drink and he will be filled with the holy spirit from his mothers womb 
many of the descendants of israel will be turned to the lord their god
he will go before the face of the lord in the spirit and power of elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteousto make ready for the lord a people prepared for him 
zechariah said to the angel how can i know this for i am an old man and my wife is advanced in her days
the angel answered and said to him i am gabriel who stands in the presence of god i was sent to speak to you to bring you this good news
behold you will be silent unable to speak until the day these things take place this is because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled at the right time 
now the people were waiting for zechariah they were surprised that he was spending so much time in the temple
but when he came out he could not speak to them they realized that he had seen a vision while he was in the temple he kept on making signs to them and remained silent
it came about that when the days of his service were over he went to his house 
after these days his wife elizabeth conceived and for five months she kept herself hidden she said
this is what the lord has done for me when he looked at me with favor in order to take away my shame before people 
in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god to a city in galilee named nazareth
to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was joseph who was a descendant of david and the virgins name was mary
he came to her and said greetings you who are highly favored the lord is with you
but she was very confused by his words and she wondered what kind of greeting this could be 
the angel said to her do not be afraid mary for you have found favor with god
see you will conceive in your womb and bear a son you will call his name jesus
he will be great and will be called the son of the most high the lord god will give him the throne of his ancestor david
he will reign over the house of jacob forever and there will be no end to his kingdom 
mary said to the angel how will this happen since i have not known any man
the angel answered and said to her the holy spirit will overshadow you and the power of the most high will overshadow you so the holy one to be born will be called the son of god 
see your relative elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age this is the sixth month for her she who was called barren
for nothing will be impossible for god
mary said see i am the female servant of the lord let it be for me according to your message then the angel left her 
then mary arose in those days and quickly went into the hill country to a city in judea
she went into the house of zechariah and greeted elizabeth
now it happened that when elizabeth heard marys greeting the baby in her womb jumped and elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit 
she cried out with a loud shout and said blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb
why has it happened to me that the mother of my lord should come to me
for see when the sound of your greeting came to my ears the baby in my womb jumped for joy
blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of the things that were told her from the lord 
mary said my soul praises the lord 
and my spirit has rejoiced in god my savior 
for he has looked  at the low condition of his female servant for see from now on all generations will call me blessed 
for the mighty one has done great things for me  and his name is holy 
his mercy lasts from generation to generation  for those who fear him
he has displayed strength with his arm  he has scattered those who were proud  about the thoughts of their hearts 
he has thrown down princes from their thrones  and he has raised up those of low condition
he has filled the hungry with good things  but the rich he has sent away emptyhanded 
he has given help to israel his servant  so as to remember to show mercy
as he said to our fathers  to abraham and his descendants forever 
mary stayed with elizabeth about three months and then returned to her house
now the time had come for elizabeth to deliver her baby and she gave birth to a son
her neighbors and her relatives heard that the lord had shown his great mercy to her and they rejoiced with her 
now it happened on the eighth day that they came to circumcise the child they would have called him zechariah after the name of his father
but his mother answered and said no he will be called john
they said to her there is no one among your relatives who is called by this name 
they made signs to his father as to how he wanted him to be named
his father asked for a writing tablet and wrote his name is john they all were astonished at this 
immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was freed he spoke and praised god
fear came on all who lived around them all these matters were spread throughout all the hill country of judea
all who heard them stored them in their hearts saying what then will this child become for the hand of the lord was with him 
his father zechariah was filled with the holy spirit and prophesied saying
praised be the lord the god of israel  for he has come to help  and he has accomplished redemption for his people 
he has raised up a horn of salvation for us  in the house of his servant david
as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from long ago 
salvation from our enemies  and from the hand of all who hate us 
he will do this to show mercy to our fathers  and to remember his holy covenant
the oath that he swore  to abraham our father
he swore to grant to us that we  having been delivered out of the hand of our enemies  would serve him without fear
in holiness and righteousness  before him all our days 
yes and you child  will be called a prophet of the most high for you will go before the face of the lord  to prepare his paths  to prepare people for his coming
to give knowledge of salvation to his people  by the forgiveness of their sins 
this will happen because  of the tender mercy of our god because of which the sunrise  from on high will come to help us
to shine on those who sit in darkness  and in the shadow of death he will do this to guide our feet  into the path of peace 
now the child grew and became strong in spirit and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to israel  
now in those days it came about that caesar augustus sent out a decree ordering that a census be taken of all the people living in the world
this was the first census made while quirinius was governor of syria
so everyone went to his own city to be registered for the census 
joseph also went up from galilee from the city of nazareth to judea to the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and family line of david
he went there to register along with mary who was engaged to him and was pregnant 
now it came about that while they were there the time came for her to deliver her baby
she gave birth to a son her firstborn child and she wrapped him in long strips of cloth and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn 
there were shepherds in that region who were staying in the fields guarding their flock at night
an angel of the lord appeared to them and the glory of the lord shone around them and they were filled with great fear 
then the angel said to them do not be afraid because i bring you good news that will bring great joy to all the people
today a savior was born for you in the city of david he is christ the lord
this is the sign that will be given to you you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger 
suddenly there was together with the angel a great multitude from heaven praising god and saying 
glory to god in the highest  and may there be peace on earth  among people with whom he is pleased  some ancient greek copies have different spellings that suggest two possible meanings of the last phrase of verse  the second being preferred the suggestions are good will toward people or among people with whom he god is pleased  
it came about that when the angels had gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said to each other let us now go to bethlehem and see this thing that has happened which the lord has made known to us
they hurried there and found mary joseph and the baby who was lying in a manger 
after they had seen him they made known what had been said to them about this child
all who heard it were amazed at what was spoken to them by the shepherds
but mary kept thinking about all the things she had heard treasuring them in her heart
the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for everything that they had heard and seen just as it had been spoken to them 
when it was the end of the eighth day when he was circumcised he was named jesus the name he had been given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb 
when the required number of days for their purification had passed according to the law of moses they brought him up to the temple in jerusalem to present him to the lord
as it is written in the law of the lord every male who opens the womb will be set apart to the lord
so they offered a sacrifice according to what was said in the law of the lord a pair of doves or two young pigeons 
behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and this man was righteous and devout he was waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy spirit was upon him
it had been revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the lords christ 
led by the spirit simeon came into the temple when the parents brought in the infant jesus to do for him according to the custom of the law
he took him into his arms and praised god and he said 
now let your servant depart in peace lord  according to your word  
for my eyes have seen your salvation 
which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples 
a light for revelation to the gentiles  and glory to your people israel 
his father and mother  some copies of the ancient greek text have his fathers name joseph  were amazed at what was said about him
simeon blessed them and said to mary his mother behold this child is appointed for the downfall and rising up of many people in israel and for a sign that is rejected
and a sword will pierce your own soulso that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed 
a prophetess named anna was there she was the daughter of phanuel from the tribe of asher she was advanced in her days she had lived with her husband for seven years after her virginity
and was a widow for eightyfour years she never left the temple but was serving with fastings and prayers night and day
at that very hour she came near to them and began giving thanks to god and she spoke about the child to everyone who had been waiting for the redemption of jerusalem 
when they had finished everything they were required to do according to the law of the lord they returned to galilee to their own town of nazareth
the child grew and became strong he was full of wisdom and the grace of god was upon him 
his parents went every year to jerusalem for the festival of the passover
when he was twelve years old they again went up at the customary time for the festival
after they had stayed the full number of days for the feast they began to return home but the boy jesus stayed behind in jerusalem and his parents did not know it
they assumed that he was with the group that was traveling with them so they traveled a days journey then they started to search carefully for him among their relatives and friends 
when they did not find him they returned to jerusalem and started to search carefully for him there
it came about that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the middle of the teachers listening to them and asking them questions
all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers 
when they saw him they were astonished his mother said to him son why have you treated us this way look your father and i have been anxiously searching for you
he said to them why were you searching for me did you not know that i had to be about my fathers business  some scholars translate about my fathers business as in my fathers house
but they did not understand what he meant by those words 
then he went back home with them to nazareth and was obedient to them his mother treasured all these things in her heart
but jesus continued to grow in wisdom and stature and increased in favor with god and people  
in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesarwhile pontius pilate was governor of judea herod was tetrarch of galilee his brother philip was tetrarch of the region of iturea and trachonitis and lysanias was tetrarch of abilene
during the high priesthood of annas and caiaphasthe word of god came to john son of zechariah in the wilderness 
he went into all the region around the jordan preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins 
as it is written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet  a voice of one crying out in the wilderness  make ready the way of the lord  make his paths straight  
every valley will be filled  and every mountain and hill will be made low  and the crooked roads will be made straight  and the uneven places will be built into roads 
and all flesh will see the salvation of god 
so john said to the crowds who were coming out to be baptized by him you offspring of vipers who warned you to run away from the wrath that is coming 
therefore produce fruits that are worthy of repentance and do not begin to say within yourselves we have abraham for our father for i tell you that god is able to raise up children for abraham from these stones 
even now the ax is set against the root of the trees so every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire 
then the crowds kept asking him saying what then are we to do
he answered and said to them if someone has two tunics he should share with a person who has none and the one having food should do the same 
tax collectors also came to be baptized and they said to him teacher what must we do
he said to them do not collect more money than you have been ordered to collect 
some soldiers also asked him saying what about us what must we do he said to them do not take money from anyone by force and do not accuse anyone falsely be content with your wages 
now as the people were eagerly expecting the christ to come everyone was wondering in their hearts concerning john whether he might be the christ
john answered by saying to them all as for me i baptize you with water but someone is coming who is more powerful than i and i am not worthy even to untie the strap of his sandals he will baptize you with the holy spirit and with fire 
his winnowing fork is in his hand to thoroughly clear off his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his storehouse but he will burn up the chaff with fire that can never be put out 
with many other exhortations also john was announcing the good news to the people
when herod the tetrarch had been reproved for marrying his brothers wife herodias and for all the other evil things that herod had done
he added this to them all that he locked john up in prison 
now it came about when all the people were baptized jesus also was baptized and while he was praying the heavens opened
and the holy spirit in bodily form came down on him like a dove and a voice came from heaven you are my beloved son i am pleased with you 
when jesus began his ministry he was about thirty years of age he was the son as it was assumed of joseph the son of heli
the son of matthat the son of levi the son of melchi the son of jannai the son of joseph 
joseph was the son of mattathias the son of amos the son of nahum the son of esli the son of naggai
the son of maath the son of mattathias the son of semein the son of josech the son of joda 
joda was the son of joanan the son of rhesa the son of zerubbabel the son of salathiel the son of neri
the son of melchi the son of addi the son of cosam the son of elmadam the son of er
the son of joshua the son of eliezer the son of jorim the son of matthat the son of levi 
levi was the son of simeon the son of judah the son of joseph the son of jonam the son of eliakim
the son of melea the son of menna the son of mattatha the son of nathan the son of david
the son of jesse the son of obed the son of boaz the son of salmon the son of nahshon 
nahshon was the son of amminadab the son of admin the son of arni the son of hezron the son of perez the son of judah
the son of jacob the son of isaac the son of abraham the son of terah the son of nahor
the son of serug the son of reu the son of peleg the son of eber the son of shelah 
shelah was the son of cainan the son of arphaxad the son of shem the son of noah the son of lamech
the son of methuselah the son of enoch the son of jared the son of mahalalel the son of cainan
the son of enos the son of seth the son of adam the son of god  
then jesus being full of the holy spirit returned from the jordan river and was led by the spirit in the wilderness
where for forty days he was tempted by the devil he ate nothing during those days and at the end of that time he was hungry 
the devil said to him if you are the son of god command this stone to become bread
jesus answered him it is written man does not live on bread alone 
then the devil led jesus up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant of time
the devil said to him i will give to you all this authority and all their glory for they have been given to me and i can give it to anyone i want
so then if you will bow down and worship me it will be yours 
but jesus answered and said to him it is written you will worship the lord your god and you will serve only him 
then the devil led jesus to jerusalem and put him on the very highest point of the temple building and said to him if you are the son of god throw yourself down from here
for it is written  he will give orders to his angels regarding you  to protect you 
and they will lift you up in their hands  so that you will not strike your foot against a stone 
answering him jesus said it is said do not put the lord your god to the test
when the devil had finished tempting jesus he went away and left him until another time 
then jesus returned to galilee in the power of the spirit and news about him spread throughout the entire surrounding region
then he began to teach in their synagogues and he was praised by all 
he came into nazareth where he had been raised and as was his custom he entered the synagogue on the sabbath day and he stood up to read aloud
the scroll of the prophet isaiah was handed to him he opened the scroll and found the place where it was written  
the spirit of the lord is upon me  because he anointed me  to announce good news to the poor  he has sent me to proclaim freedom to the captives  and recovery of sight to the blind  to set free those who are oppressed 
to proclaim the year of the lords favor 
then he rolled up the scroll gave it back to the attendant and sat down the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him
he began to speak to them today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing
everyone there spoke well of him and they were amazed at the gracious words which were coming out of his mouth and they asked is this not the son of joseph 
he said to them surely you will say this proverb to me doctor heal yourself whatever we heard that you did in capernaum do the same in your hometown
but he said truly i say to you no prophet is received in his own hometown 
but in truth i tell you that there were many widows in israel during the time of elijah when the sky was shut up for three years and six months and a great famine came upon all the land
but elijah was sent to none of them but only to zarephath in sidon to a widow living there
there were many lepers in israel during the time of elisha the prophet but none of them were cleansed except naaman the syrian 
all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage when they heard these things
they got up forced him out of the town and led him to the cliff of the hill on which their town was built so they might throw him off the cliff
but he passed through the middle of them and he went to another place 
then he went down to capernaum a city in galilee and he began to teach them on the sabbath
they were astonished at his teaching because he spoke with authority 
now in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon and he cried out with a loud voice
ah what do we have to do with you jesus of nazareth have you come to destroy us i know who you arethe holy one of god 
jesus rebuked the demon saying do not speak come out of him when the demon had thrown the man down in the middle of them he came out of him and did not harm him in any way
all the people were very amazed and they kept talking about it with one another they said what kind of words are these he commands the unclean spirits with authority and power and they come out
so news about him began to spread into every part of the surrounding region 
then jesus left the synagogue and entered into the house of simon now simons motherinlaw was suffering with a high fever and they pleaded with him on her behalf
so he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her immediately she got up and started serving them 
when the sun was setting people brought to jesus everyone who was sick with various kinds of diseases he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them
demons also came out from many of them crying out and saying you are the son of god jesus rebuked the demons and would not let them speak because they knew that he was the christ 
when daybreak came he went out into a solitary place crowds of people were looking for him and came to the place where he was they tried to keep him from going away from them
but he said to them i must also preach the gospel about the kingdom of god to many other cities because this is the reason i was sent here
then he continued to preach in the synagogues throughout judea  
now it happened while the people were crowding around jesus and listening to the word of god that he was standing by the lake of gennesaret
he saw two boats pulled up by the edge of the lake the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets
jesus got into one of the boats which was simons and asked him to put it out in the water a short distance from the land then he sat down and taught the people out of the boat 
when he had finished speaking he said to simon take the boat out into the deeper water and let down your nets for a catch
simon answered and said master we have labored all night and caught nothing but at your word i will let down the nets
when they had done this they gathered a very large number of fish and their nets were breaking
so they motioned to their partners in the other boat that they should come and help them they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink 
but simon peter when he saw it fell down at jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a sinful man lord
for he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish which they had taken
and so also were james and john sons of zebedee who were partners with simon jesus said to simon do not be afraid because from now on you will catch men
when they had brought their boats to land they left everything and followed him 
it came about that while he was in one of the cities a man full of leprosy was there when he saw jesus he fell on his face and begged him saying lord if you are willing you can make me clean
then jesus reached out his hand and touched him saying i am willing be clean immediately the leprosy left him 
he instructed him to tell no one but told him go on your way and show yourself to the priest and offer a sacrifice for your cleansing according to what moses commanded for a testimony to them 
but the report about him spread even farther and large crowds of people came together to hear him teach and to be healed of their sicknesses
but he often withdrew into the deserted places and prayed 
it came about on one of those days that he was teaching and there were pharisees and teachers of the law sitting there who had come from every village of galilee and judea and from jerusalem the power of the lord was with him to heal 
now some men came carrying on a mat a man who was paralyzed and they looked for a way to bring him inside in order to lay him down in front of jesus
they could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd so they went up to the housetop and let the man down through the tiles on his mat into the midst of the people right in front of jesus 
seeing their faith jesus said man your sins are forgiven you
the scribes and the pharisees began to question this saying who is this who speaks blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone 
but jesus knowing what they were thinking answered and said to them why are you questioning this in your hearts
which is easier to say your sins are forgiven you or to say get up and walk
but that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sinshe said to the paralyzed mani tell you get up pick up your mat and go to your house 
immediately he got up in front of them and picked up the mat on which he was lying then he went away to his house glorifying god
everyone was amazed and they glorified god they were filled with fear saying we have seen extraordinary things today 
after these things happened jesus went out from there and saw a tax collector named levi sitting at the tax collectors tent he said to him follow me
so levi got up and followed him leaving everything behind 
then levi gave a big banquet in his house for jesus there were many tax collectors there and other people who were reclining at the table and eating with them
but the pharisees and their scribes were complaining to his disciples saying why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners
jesus answered them people who are well do not need a physician only those who are sick
i did not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance 
they said to him the disciples of john often fast and pray and the disciples of the pharisees do the same but your disciples eat and drink
jesus said to them can anyone make the wedding attendants of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is still with them
but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them then in those days they will fast 
then jesus also spoke a parable to them no one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to mend an old garment if he does that he will tear the new garment and the piece of cloth from the new garment will not fit with the cloth of the old garment 
no one puts new wine into old wineskins if he does that the new wine will burst the skins and the wine will be spilled and the wineskins will be destroyed
but new wine must be put into fresh wineskins
no one after drinking old wine wants the new for he says the old is better  
now it happened on a sabbath that jesus was going through the grainfields and his disciples were picking the heads of grain rubbing them between their hands and eating the grain
but some of the pharisees said why are you doing something that is not lawful to do on the sabbath day 
answering them jesus said have you not even read what david did when he was hungry he and the men who were with him
he went into the house of god and took the bread of the presence and ate some of it and also gave some to the men who were with him to eat even though it was only lawful for the priests to eat it
then he said to them the son of man is lord of the sabbath 
it happened on another sabbath that he went into the synagogue and taught the people there a man was there whose right hand was withered
the scribes and the pharisees were watching him closely to see whether he would heal someone on the sabbath so that they might find a reason to accuse him
but he knew what they were thinking and he said to the man whose hand was withered get up and stand here in the middle of everyone so the man got up and stood there 
jesus said to them i ask you is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm to save a life or to destroy it
then he looked around at them all and said to the man stretch out your hand he did so and his hand was restored
but they were filled with senseless rage and they talked to each other about what they might do to jesus 
it happened in those days that he went out to the mountain to pray he continued all night in prayer to god
when it was day he called his disciples to him and he chose twelve of them whom he also named apostles 
the names of the apostles were simon whom he also named peter and his brother andrew james john philip bartholomew
matthew thomas james son of alphaeus simon who was called the zealot
judas son of james and judas iscariot who became a traitor 
then jesus came down the mountain with them and stood on a level place with a large crowd of his disciples and a large number of the people from judea and jerusalem and the seacoast of tyre and sidon
they had come to listen to him and to be healed of their diseases people who were troubled with unclean spirits were also healed
everyone in the crowd kept trying to touch him because power to heal was coming out from him and he healed them all 
then he looked at his disciples and said blessed are you who are poor  for yours is the kingdom of god
blessed are you who hunger now  for you will be filled blessed are you who weep now  for you will laugh 
blessed are you when people hate you  and when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil  because of the son of man
rejoice in that day and leap for joy because you will surely have a great reward in heaven for their ancestors treated the prophets in the same way 
but woe to you who are rich  for you have already received your comfort
woe to you who are full now  for you will be hungry later woe to you who laugh now  for you will mourn and weep later 
woe to you when all men speak well of you  for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets 
but i say to you who are listening love your enemies and do good to those who hate you
bless those who curse you and pray for those who mistreat you 
to him who strikes you on the one cheek offer him also the other if someone takes away your coat do not withhold your tunic either
give to everyone who asks you if someone takes away something that belongs to you do not ask him to give it back to you 
as you want people to do to you you should do the same to them
if you only love people who love you what reward is there for you for even sinners love those who love them
if you do good only to people who do good to you what reward is there for you for even sinners do the same
if you only lend to people from whom you hope to be repaid what reward is there for you even sinners lend to sinners to receive back the same amount 
but love your enemies and do good to them lend expecting nothing in return and your reward will be great and you will be sons of the most high for he himself is kind toward unthankful and evil people
be merciful just as your father is merciful 
do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned forgive others and you will be forgiven 
give and it will be given to you a good amountpressed down shaken together and spilling overwill pour into your lap for with the measure you use it will be measured back to you 
then he also told them a parable can a blind person guide another blind person if he did they would both fall into a pit would they not
a disciple is not greater than his teacher but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher 
why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brothers eye but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye
how can you say to your brother brother let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye when you yourself do not even see the log that is in your own eye you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take out the piece of straw that is in your brothers eye 
for there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit nor is there a rotten tree that produces good fruit
for each tree is known by the kind of fruit it produces for people do not gather figs from a thornbush nor do they gather grapes from a briar bush 
the good man from the good treasure of his heart produces what is good and the evil man from the evil treasure of his heart produces what is evil for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks 
why do you call me lord lord and yet you do not obey the things that i say
every person who comes to me and hears my words and obeys them i will tell you what he is like
he is like a man building a house who dug down deep in the ground and built the houses foundation on solid rock when a flood came the torrent of water flowed against that house but could not shake it because it had been well built 
but the person who hears my words and does not obey them he is like a man who built a house on top of the ground without a foundation when the torrent of water flowed against that house it immediately collapsed and the ruin of that house was complete  
after jesus had finished everything he was saying in the hearing of the people he entered capernaum 
now a centurion had a slave who was highly regarded by him and he was sick and about to die
when the centurion heard about jesus he sent to him elders of the jews asking him to come and heal his servant
when they had come to jesus they asked him earnestly saying he is worthy to have you do this for him
because he loves our nation and he is the one who built the synagogue for us 
so jesus continued on his way with them but when he was not far from the house the centurion sent friends to say to him lord do not trouble yourself because i am not worthy for you to come under my roof
for this reason i did not even consider myself worthy to come to you but just say a word and my servant will be healed
for i also am a man who is under authority with soldiers under me i say to this one go and he goes and to another one come and he comes and to my servant do this and he does it 
when jesus heard this he was amazed at him and turning to the crowd following him said i say to you not even in israel have i found such faith
when those who had been sent returned to the house they found the servant was healthy 
soon after that jesus went to a town called nain and his disciples and a great crowd went with him
as he came near to the gate of the town behold a man who had died was being carried out the only son of his mother who was a widow and a rather large crowd from the town was with her
when the lord saw her he was deeply moved with compassion for her and said to her do not cry
then he went up and touched the wooden frame on which they carried the body and those carrying it stood still he said young man i say to you arise
the dead man sat up and began to speak and jesus gave him to his mother 
then fear overcame all of them and they kept praising god saying a great prophet has been raised among us and god has looked upon his people
this news about jesus spread throughout the whole of judea and all the neighboring regions 
johns disciples told him about all these things then john called two of his disciples
and sent them to the lord to say are you the one who is to come or should we look for another
when they had come near to jesus the men said john the baptist has sent us to you to say are you the one who is coming or should we look for another 
in that hour he healed many people from sicknesses and afflictions and from evil spirits and to many blind people he gave sight
jesus answered and said to them after you have gone on your way report to john what you have seen and heard blind people are receiving sight lame people are walking lepers are being cleansed deaf people are hearing people who have died are being raised back to life and the poor are being told good news
the person who does not stop believing in me because of my actions is blessed 
after johns messengers had gone away jesus began to say to the crowds about john what did you go out into the desert to see a reed shaken by the wind
but what did you go out to see a man dressed in soft clothes look those who wear splendid clothing and who live in luxury are in kings palaces
but what did you go out to see a prophet yes i say to you and more than a prophet 
this is he of whom it is written see i am sending my messenger before your face  who will prepare your way before you
i say to you among those born of women none is greater than john yet the one who is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he is 
when all the people heard this including the tax collectors they declared that god is righteous because they had been baptized with the baptism of john
but the pharisees and the experts in the law rejected gods purpose for themselves because they had not been baptized by john 
to what then can i compare the people of this generation what are they like
they are like children playing in the marketplace who sit and call to one another and say we played a flute for you  and you did not dance we sang a funeral song  and you did not cry 
for john the baptist came eating no bread and drinking no wine and you say he has a demon
the son of man came eating and drinking and you say look he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners
but wisdom is justified by all her children 
now one of the pharisees invited jesus to eat with him so after jesus entered into the pharisees house he reclined at the table to eat
behold there was a woman in the city who was a sinner when she found out that he was reclining at the table in the pharisees house she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil
as she stood behind him near his feet weeping she began to wet his feet with her tears and she wiped them with her hair and kissed them and anointed them with perfumed oil 
when the pharisee who had invited jesus saw this he thought to himself saying if this man were a prophet then he would know who and what type of woman is touching him that she is a sinner
jesus responded and said to him simon i have something to say to you he said say it teacher 
jesus said a certain moneylender had two debtors the one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty
when they could not pay him he forgave them both therefore which of them will love him more
simon answered him and said i suppose the one whom he forgave the most jesus said to him you have judged correctly 
jesus turned to the woman and said to simon you see this woman i have entered into your house you gave me no water for my feet but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair
you did not give me a kiss but from the time i came in she did not stop kissing my feet 
you did not anoint my head with oil but she has anointed my feet with perfumed oil
for this reason i say to you her sins which were many have been forgivenfor she loved much but the one who is forgiven little loves little 
then he said to her your sins are forgiven
those reclining together began to say among themselves who is this that even forgives sins
then jesus said to the woman your faith has saved you go in peace  
it happened soon afterward that jesus began traveling around to different cities and villages preaching and proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of god the twelve were with him
as well as certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases mary who was called magdalene from whom seven demons had been driven out
joanna the wife of chuza herods manager susanna and many others who out of their possessions provided for their needs 
while a large crowd of people was gathering and people were coming to him from town after town he told a parable
a farmer went out to sow his seed as he sowed some fell beside the road and it was trampled underfoot and the birds of the sky devoured it
some fell on the rock and as soon as it grew up it withered away because it had no moisture 
some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up together with the seed and choked it
but some fell on good soil and produced a crop that was a hundred times greater after jesus had said these things he called out whoever has ears to hear let him hear 
his disciples asked him what this parable meant
he said the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of god has been given to you but for others i speak in parables so that seeing they may not see  and hearing they may not understand 
now this is the meaning of the parable the seed is the word of god
the ones along the road are those who have heard but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts so they may not believe and be saved
the ones on the rock are those who when they hear the word receive it with joy but they have no root they believe for a while and in a time of testing they fall away 
the seeds that fell among the thorns are people who hear the word but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life and their fruit does not mature
but the seed that fell on the good soil these are the ones who hearing the word with an honest and good heart hold it securely and bear fruit with patient endurance 
no one lights a lamp and covers it with a bowl or puts it under a bed rather he puts it on a lampstand so that everyone who enters may see the light
for nothing is hidden that will not be made known nor is anything secret that will not be known and come into the light
so listen carefully for to the one who has more will be given to him but the one who does not have even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him 
then his mother and brothers came to him but they could not get near him because of the crowd
he was told your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you
but jesus answered and said to them my mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of god and do it 
now one day he got into a boat with his disciples and he said to them let us go over to the other side of the lake they set sail
but as they sailed he fell asleep a terrible windstorm came down on the lake and their boat was filling with water and they were in danger 
then jesus disciples came over to him and woke him up saying master master we are about to die he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm
then he said to them where is your faith but they were afraid and amazed and they asked one another who then is this that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him 
they sailed to the region of the gerasenes which is across the lake from galilee
when jesus stepped on the land he was met by a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time he had worn no clothes and he did not live in a house but among the tombs 
when he saw jesus he cried out and fell down before him and he said with a loud voice what have you to do with me jesus son of the most high god i beg you do not torment me
for jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man for many times it had seized him and though he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard he had broken his chains and he would be driven by the demon into the wilderness 
then jesus asked him what is your name he said legion for many demons had entered into him
they kept begging him not to command them to go away into the abyss 
now a large herd of pigs was there feeding on the hillside the demons begged him to let them go into them and he gave them permission
so the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and was drowned 
when those tending the pigs saw what had happened they ran off and told about it in the city and countryside
so the people went out to see what had happened and they came to jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out he was sitting at the feet of jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid 
then those who had seen it told them how the man who had been possessed by demons had been healed
then all the people of the region of the gerasenes asked jesus to depart from them for they were overwhelmed with great fear so he got into the boat and returned 
the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him to let him go with him but jesus sent him away saying
return to your home and give a full account of what god has done for you the man went on his way proclaiming throughout the whole city what jesus had done for him 
now when jesus returned the crowd welcomed him for they were all expecting him
behold a man named jairus who was one of the leaders of the synagogue came and fell down at jesus feet and he begged him to come to his house
because his only daughter a girl of about twelve years of age was dying as jesus was on his way the crowds of people pressed together around him 
now a woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years  scholars are divided whether the phrase and had spent all her money on physicians should be included here and could not be healed by anyone
she came behind jesus and touched the edge of his coat and immediately her bleeding stopped 
jesus said who was it who touched me when all denied it peter said master the crowds of people are all around you and they are pressing in against you
but jesus said someone did touch me for i know that power has gone out from me 
when the woman saw that she could not escape notice she came trembling and fell down before him in the presence of all the people she declared why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed
then he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace 
while he was still speaking someone came from the synagogue leaders house saying your daughter is dead do not trouble the teacher any longer
but when jesus heard this he answered jairus do not be afraid only believe and she will be healed 
when he came to the house he allowed no one to enter with him except peter and john and james and the father of the child and her mother
now all were mourning and wailing for her but he said do not weep she is not dead but asleep
but they began to mock him knowing that she was dead 
but he took her by the hand and called out saying child get up
her spirit returned and she rose up immediately he ordered them to get her something to eat
her parents were astonished but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened  
he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases
he sent them out to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick 
he said to them take nothing for your journeyno staff no wallet no bread no money and no extra tunic
whatever house you enter stay there until you leave 
wherever they do not receive you when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them
then they departed and went through the villages proclaiming the gospel and healing everywhere 
now herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening and he was perplexed because it was said by some that john had risen from the dead
and others said that elijah had appeared and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had risen
herod said i beheaded john who is this about whom i hear such things and so he tried to see him 
when the apostles returned they told him everything they had done then he took them with him and they went away privately to a town called bethsaida
but when the crowds heard about this they followed him he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of god and he cured those who needed healing 
now the day was about to come to an end and the twelve came to him and said send the crowd away that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and food because we are here in an isolated place
but he said to them you give them something to eat they said we have no more than five loaves of bread and two fishunless we go and buy food for all these people
there were about five thousand men he said to his disciples have them sit down in groups of about fifty each 
so they did this and made the people sit down
taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven he blessed them and broke them into pieces and he gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd
they all ate and were satisfied and what was left over was picked uptwelve baskets of broken pieces 
it came about while jesus was praying by himself the disciples were with him he questioned them saying who do the crowds say that i am
they answered john the baptist but others say elijah and others say that one of the prophets from long ago has risen 
then he said to them but who do you say that i am peter answered the christ of god
but he warned and instructed them to tell this to no one
saying the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes and he will be killed and on the third day be raised 
then he said to them all if anyone wants to come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me
whoever would save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it
what profit is there for a person to gain the whole world and yet lose or forfeit himself 
whoever is ashamed of me and my words of him will the son of man be ashamed when he comes in his own glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels
but truly i say to you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of god 
now about eight days after jesus said these words he took with him peter and john and james and went up on the mountain to pray
as he was praying the form of his face was changed and his clothes became brilliant white 
behold two men were talking with him moses and elijah
who appeared in glory talking with him about his departure which he was about to bring to completion in jerusalem 
now peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him
as they were going away from jesus peter said to him master it is good for us to be here let us make three shelters one for you one for moses and one for elijah he did not know what he was saying 
as he was saying this a cloud came and overshadowed them and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud
a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my son the one who is chosen listen to him
when the voice had spoken jesus was found alone they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen 
now on the next day when they came down from the mountain a large crowd met him
behold a man from the crowd cried out saying teacher i beg you to look at my son for he is my only child
you see a spirit takes control over him and he suddenly screams it causes him to have convulsions so that he foams at the mouth it hardly ever leaves him and it bruises him badly
i begged your disciples to force it out but they could not 
jesus answered and said you unbelieving and perverse generation how long must i be with you and put up with you bring your son here
while the boy was coming the demon threw him to the ground and shook him with convulsions but jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father 
then they were all amazed at the greatness of god while they all were marveling at everything he was doing he said to his disciples
let these words go deeply into your ears the son of man will be betrayed into the hands of men
but they did not understand this statement it was hidden from them so they could not know its meaning and yet they were afraid to ask about this statement 
then an argument started among them about which of them would be the greatest
but jesus knowing the reasoning in their hearts took a little child and put him by his side
and said to them whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me for whoever is least among you all is the one who is great 
john answered master we saw someone forcing out demons in your name and we prevented him because he does not follow along with us
do not stop him jesus said because whoever is not against you is for you 
when the days drew near for him to be taken up he set his face to go to jerusalem
he sent messengers on ahead of him and they went and entered into a samaritan village to prepare everything for him
but the people there did not welcome him because he had set his face to go to jerusalem 
when the disciples james and john saw this they said lord do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them
but he turned and rebuked them
and they went on to another village 
as they were going along the road someone said to him i will follow you wherever you go
jesus said to him foxes have holes and birds in the sky have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head 
then he said to another follow me but he said lord first let me go and bury my father
but he said to him leave the dead to bury their own dead but as for you go and proclaim far and wide the kingdom of god 
then someone else said i will follow you lord but first let me say goodbye to those in my home
jesus replied to him no one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of god  
now after these things the lord appointed seventy  many of the best ancient copies read seventy but some read seventytwo others and sent them out two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he himself was about to go
he said to them the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few therefore ask the lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest 
go on your way see i send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves
do not carry a money bag or a travelers bag or sandals and greet no one on the road 
whatever house you enter first say may peace be on this house
if a son of peace is there your peace will rest upon him but if not it will return to you
remain in that same house eating and drinking what they provide for the laborer is worthy of his wages do not move around from house to house 
whatever town you enter and they receive you eat what is set before you
and heal the sick that are there say to them the kingdom of god has come close to you 
whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you go out into its streets and say
even the dust from your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you but know this the kingdom of god is near
i say to you that on that day it will be more tolerable for sodom than for that town 
woe to you chorazin woe to you bethsaida if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes
but it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment than for you
you capernaum do you think you will be exalted to heaven no you will be brought down to hades 
the one who listens to you listens to me and the one who rejects you rejects me and the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me 
the seventy returned with joy saying lord even the demons submitted to us in your name
jesus said to them i was watching satan fall from heaven as lightning
see i have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing will in any way hurt you
nevertheless do not rejoice only in this that the spirits submit to you but rejoice even more that your names are engraved in heaven 
at that same hour he rejoiced greatly in the holy spirit and said i praise you father lord of heaven and earth because you concealed these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to those who are untaught like little children yes father for so it was well pleasing in your sight 
all things have been entrusted to me from my father and no one knows who the son is except the father and no one knows who the father is except the son and those to whom the son chooses to reveal him 
then he turned around to the disciples and said privately blessed are those who see the things that you see
i say to you many prophets and kings desired to see the things you see and they did not see them and to hear the things that you hear and they did not hear them 
behold an expert in the law stood up so that he might test him saying teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life
jesus said to him what is written in the law how do you read it
he gave an answer and he said you will love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself
jesus said to him you have answered correctly do this and you will live 
but he desiring to justify himself said to jesus who is my neighbor
jesus answered him and said a certain man was going down from jerusalem to jericho he fell among robbers who stripped him of his belongings and beat him and left him half dead 
by chance a certain priest was going down that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side
in the same way a levite also when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side 
but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came to where he was when he saw him he was moved with compassion
he approached him and bound up his wounds pouring oil and wine on them he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him
the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the host and said take care of him and whatever extra you spend when i return i will repay you 
which of these three do you think was a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers
he said the one who showed mercy to him jesus said to him go and do the same 
now as they were traveling along he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha welcomed him into her house
she had a sister named mary who sat at the lords feet and heard his word 
but martha was overly busy with preparing to serve a meal she came up to jesus and said lord do you not care that my sister left me to serve alone therefore tell her to help me
but the lord answered and said to her martha martha you are anxious and troubled about many things
but only one thing is necessary mary has chosen what is best which will not be taken away from her  
it happened one day that jesus was praying in a certain place when he had finished one of his disciples said to him lord teach us to pray just as john taught his disciples 
jesus said to them when you pray say father may your name be honored as holy may your kingdom come 
give us our daily bread each day
forgive us our sins  as we forgive everyone who is in debt to us do not lead us into temptation 
jesus said to them which of you will have a friend and will go to him at midnight and say to him friend lend to me three loaves of bread
since a friend of mine just came in from the road and i do not have anything to set before him
then the one inside who answered him may say do not bother me the door is already shut and my children along with me are in bed i am not able to get up and give bread to you
i say to you even if he does not get up and give bread to you because you are his friend yet because of your shameless persistence he will get up and give you as many loaves of bread as you need 
i also say to you ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and it will be opened to you
for every asking person receives and the seeking person finds and to the person who knocks it will be opened 
which father among you if your son asks for a fish will give him a snake instead of a fish  the best ancient copies have the shorter reading some ancient copies have a longer reading which also is found in matthew  which father among you if your son asks for a loaf of bread will give him a stone or a fish will give him a snake
or if he asks for an egg will you give a scorpion to him
therefore if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father from heaven give the holy spirit to those who ask him 
now jesus was driving out a demon that was mute when the demon had gone out the man who had been mute spoke and the crowd was amazed
but some of the people said by beelzebul the ruler of demons he is driving out demons 
others tested him and sought from him a sign from heaven
but jesus knew their thoughts and said to them every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate and a house divided against itself falls 
if satan is divided against himself how will his kingdom stand for you say i cast out demons by beelzebul
if i drive out demons by beelzebul by whom do your followers drive them out because of this they will be your judges
but if i drive out demons by the finger of god then the kingdom of god has come to you 
when a strong man who is fully armed guards his own palace his possessions are safe
but when a stronger man overcomes him the stronger man takes away the armor in which the man trusted and plunders the mans possessions
the one who is not with me is against me and the one who does not gather with me scatters 
when an unclean spirit has gone away from a man it passes through waterless places and looks for rest finding none it says i will return to my house from which i came
having returned it finds the house had been swept clean and put in order
then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more evil than itself and they all come in to live there then the final condition of that man becomes worse than the first 
it happened that as he said these things a certain woman raised her voice above the crowd and said to him blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you
but he said rather blessed are they who hear the word of god and keep it 
as the crowds were increasing jesus began to say this generation is an evil generation it seeks a sign though no sign will be given to it except the sign of jonah
for just as jonah became a sign to the ninevites so too the son of man will be a sign to this generation 
the queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and see someone greater than solomon is here 
the men of nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation of people and will condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonah and see someone greater than jonah is here 
no one after lighting a lamp puts it in a hidden place or under a basket but on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light
your eye is the lamp of the body when your eye is good the whole body is filled with light but when your eye is bad your body is full of darkness
therefore watch out that the light in you is not darkness
if then your whole body is full of light not having any member in darkness then your whole body will be like when a lamp shines its brightness on you 
when he had finished speaking a pharisee asked him to eat with him at his house so jesus went in and reclined
the pharisee was surprised that jesus did not first wash before dinner 
but the lord said to him now then you pharisees clean the outside of cups and bowls but the inside of you is filled with robbery and evil
you senseless men did not the one who made the outside also make the inside
give what is inside as alms and then all things will be clean for you 
but woe to you pharisees because you tithe mint and rue and every other garden herb but you neglect justice and the love of god it is necessary to act justly and love god without failing to do the other things also 
woe to you pharisees for you love the front seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces
woe to you for you are like unmarked graves that people walk over without knowing it 
one of the experts in the law said to him teacher what you say insults us too
jesus said woe to you teachers of the law for you put people under burdens that are hard to carry but you do not touch the burdens with one of your own fingers 
woe to you because you build tombs for the prophets and it was your ancestors who killed them
so you are witnesses and you consent to the works of your ancestors for they indeed killed them and you build their tombs 
for this reason also gods wisdom said i will send to them prophets and apostles and they will persecute and kill some of them
as a result this generation will be charged for all the blood of the prophets shed since the foundation of the world
from abels blood to the blood of zechariah who was killed between the altar and the temple yes i say to you this generation will be held responsible 
woe to you experts in the law because you have taken away the key of knowledge you do not enter in yourselves and you hinder those who are entering 
after jesus left there the scribes and the pharisees opposed him and argued with him about many things
lying in wait to catch him in something he might say  
in the meantime when many thousands of the people were gathered together so much that they trampled on each other he began to say to his disciples first of all beware of the yeast of the pharisees which is hypocrisy 
but there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed and nothing hidden that will not be known
so whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light and what you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops 
i say to you my friends do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that they have no more that they can do
but i will warn you about whom to fear fear the one who after he has killed has authority to throw you into hell yes i say to you fear him 
are not five sparrows sold for two small coins yet not one of them is forgotten in the sight of god
but even the hairs of your head are all numbered do not fear you are more valuable than many sparrows 
i say to you everyone who confesses me before men the son of man will also confess before the angels of god
but he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of god
everyone who speaks a word against the son of man it will be forgiven him but to him who blasphemes against the holy spirit it will not be forgiven 
when they bring you before the synagogues the rulers and the authorities do not worry about how you will speak in your defense or what you will say
for the holy spirit will teach you in that hour what you should say 
then someone from the crowd said to him teacher tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me
jesus said to him man who appointed me a judge or a mediator over you
he said to them watch that you keep yourselves from all greedy desires because a persons life does not consist of the abundance of his possessions 
then jesus told them a parable saying the field of a rich man yielded abundantly
and he reasoned with himself saying what will i do because i do not have a place to store my crops
he said this is what i will do i will tear down my barns and build bigger ones and there i will store all of my grain and other goods
i will say to my soul soul you have many goods stored up for many years rest easy eat drink be merry 
but god said to him foolish man tonight your soul is required of you and the things you have prepared whose will they be
that is what someone is like who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god 
jesus said to his disciples therefore i say to you do not worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear
for life is more than food and the body is more than clothes 
think about the ravens that they do not sow or reap they have no storeroom or barn but god feeds them how much more valuable you are than the birds
which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his lifespan
if then you are not able to do such a very little thing why do you worry about the rest 
think about the lilieshow they grow they do not labor neither do they spin yet i say to you even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these
if god so clothes the grass in the field which exists today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven how much more will he clothe you o you of little faith 
do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink and do not be anxious
for all the nations of the world seek these things and your father knows that you need them 
but seek his kingdom and these things will be added to you
do not fear little flock because your father is very pleased to give you the kingdom 
sell your possessions and give alms make for yourselves purses which will not wear outtreasure in the heavens that does not run out where no thief comes near and no moth destroys
for where your treasure is there your heart will be also 
keep your loins girded and your lamps lit
and be like people waiting expectantly for their master when he returns from the marriage feast so that when he comes and knocks they may immediately open the door for him 
blessed are those servants whom the master will find watching when he comes truly i say to you he will gird himself to serve and have them sit down at the table and he will come and serve them
if the master comes in the second watch of the night or if even in the third watch and finds them ready blessed are those servants 
but understand this that if the master of the house had known the hour the thief was coming he would not have let his house be broken into
you also must be ready because the son of man is coming at an hour that you do not expect 
peter said lord are you telling this parable only to us or also to everyone
the lord said who then is the faithful and wise manager whom his lord will set over his other servants to give them their portion of food at the right time
blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing that when he comes
truly i say to you that he will set him over all his property 
but if that servant says in his heart my lord delays his return and begins to beat the male servants and female servants and to eat and drink and to become drunk
the lord of that servant will come in a day when he does not expect and in an hour that he does not know and will cut him in pieces and appoint a place for him with the unfaithful 
that servant having known his lords will and not having prepared or done according to his will will be beaten with many blows
but the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating he will be beaten with a few blows but everyone who has been given much from them much will be required and from the one who has been entrusted with much even more will be asked 
i came to cast fire upon the earth and how i wish that it were already kindled
but i have a baptism to be baptized with and how i am distressed until it is completed 
do you think that i came to bring peace on the earth no i tell you but rather division
for from now on there will be five in one house dividedthree people against two and two people against three
they will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against mother motherinlaw against her daughterinlaw and daughterinlaw against motherinlaw 
jesus was saying to the crowds also when you see a cloud rising in the west immediately you say a shower is coming and so it happens
when a south wind is blowing you say there will be a scorching heat and it happens
hypocrites you know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the heavens but how is it that you do not know how to interpret the present time 
why do you not judge what is right for yourselves
for when you go with your adversary before the magistrate on the way make an effort to be reconciled with him so that he does not drag you to the judge and so that the judge does not deliver you to the officer and the officer does not throw you into prison
i say to you you will never come out from there until you have paid the very last bit of money  
at that time some people there told him about the galileans whose blood pilate mixed with their own sacrifices
jesus answered and said to them do you think that these galileans were more sinful than all the other galileans because they suffered in this way
no i tell you but if you do not repent all of you will perish in the same way 
or those eighteen people in siloam on whom a tower fell and killed them do you think they were worse sinners than other men in jerusalem
no i say but if you do not repent all of you will also perish 
jesus told this parable someone had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and looked for fruit on it but found none
the man said to the gardener look for three years i have come and tried to find fruit on this fig tree and found none cut it down why let it waste the ground 
the gardener answered and said sir leave it alone this year while i dig around it and put manure on it
if it bears fruit next year good but if it does not cut it down 
now jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues during the sabbath
behold a woman was there who for eighteen years had a spirit of weakness she was bent over and was not able to straighten up completely 
when jesus saw her he called to her and said woman you are freed from your weakness
he placed his hands on her and immediately she was made straight again and glorified god
but the synagogue ruler was indignant because jesus had healed on the sabbath so the ruler answered and said to the crowd there are six days in which it is necessary to labor come and be healed then not on the sabbath day 
the lord answered him and said hypocrites does not each of you untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it to drink on the sabbath
so too this daughter of abraham whom satan bound for eighteen long years should her bonds not be untied on the sabbath day 
as he said these things all those who opposed him were ashamed but the whole crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things he did 
then jesus said what is the kingdom of god like and what can i compare it to
it is like a mustard seed that a man took and threw into his garden and it grew into a big tree and the birds of heaven built their nests in its branches 
again he said to what can i compare the kingdom of god
it is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all the flour was leavened 
then jesus traveled through the towns and villages teaching and making his way toward jerusalem
someone said to him lord are only a few people to be saved so he said to them
struggle to enter through the narrow door because i say to you many will try to enter but will not be able to enter 
once the owner of the house gets up and locks the door then you will stand outside and pound the door and say lord lord let us in he will answer and say to you i do not know you or where you are from
then you will say we ate and drank in front of you and you taught in our streets
but he will reply i say to you i do not know where you are from get away from me all you workers of unrighteousness 
there will be crying and the grinding of teeth when you see abraham isaac jacob and all the prophets in gods kingdom but you are thrown out
they will come from the east west north and south and be seated at a table in the kingdom of god
know this those who are least important will be first and those who are most important will be last 
in that same hour some pharisees came and said to him go and leave here because herod wants to kill you
jesus said go and tell that fox look i cast out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow and the third day i will reach my goal
in any case it is necessary for me to continue on today tomorrow and the following day since it is not acceptable for a prophet to be destroyed outside of jerusalem 
jerusalem jerusalem who kills the prophets and stones those sent to you how often i desired to gather your children the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings but you did not desire this
see your house is abandoned i say to you you will not see me until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord  
it happened one sabbath when he went into the house of one of the leaders of the pharisees to eat bread that they were watching him closely
behold there in front of him was a man who was suffering from edema
jesus asked the experts in the jewish law and the pharisees is it lawful to heal on the sabbath or not 
but they kept silent so jesus took hold of him healed him and sent him away
he said to them which of you who has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the sabbath day will not immediately pull him out
they were not able to give an answer to these things 
when jesus noticed how those who were invited chose the seats of honor he spoke a parable saying to them
when you are invited by someone to a wedding feast do not sit down in the place of honor because someone may have been invited who is more honored than you
when the person who invited both of you arrives he will say to you give this other person your place and then in shame you will proceed to take the lowest place 
but when you are invited go and sit down in the lowest place so that when the one who has invited you comes he may say to you friend go up higher then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you
for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted 
jesus also said to the man who had invited him when you give a dinner or a banquet do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors as they may also invite you in return and you will be repaid 
but when you give a banquet invite the poor the crippled the lame and the blind
and you will be blessed because they cannot repay you for you will be repaid in the resurrection of the just 
when one of them who sat at the table with jesus heard these things he said to him blessed is he who will eat bread in the kingdom of god
but jesus said to him a certain man prepared a large dinner and invited many
at the dinner hour he sent his servant to say to those who were invited come because everything is now ready 
they all alike began to make excuses the first said to him i have bought a field and i must go out and see it please excuse me
another said i have bought five pairs of oxen and i am going to try them out please excuse me
then another man said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come 
the servant came and told his master these things then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the town and bring in here the poor the crippled the blind and the lame
the servant said master what you commanded has been done and yet there is still room 
the master said to the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled
for i say to you none of those men who were invited will taste my dinner 
now large crowds were going with him and he turned and said to them
if anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father mother wife children brothers and sisters and even his own life he cannot be my disciple
whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple 
for which of you who desires to build a tower does not first sit down and count the cost to calculate if he has what he needs to complete it
otherwise when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish all who see it will begin to mock him
saying this man began to build and was not able to finish 
or what king as he goes to encounter another king in war will not sit down first and take advice about whether he is able with ten thousand men to fight the other king who comes against him with twenty thousand men
if not while the other army is still far away he sends a delegation and asks for conditions of peace
so therefore any one of you who does not give up all his possessions cannot be my disciple 
salt is good but if the salt has lost its taste how can it be made salty again
it is of no use for the soil or even for the manure pile it is thrown away he who has ears to hear let him hear  
now all the tax collectors and other sinners were coming to jesus to listen to him
both the pharisees and the scribes grumbled to each other saying this man welcomes sinners and even eats with them 
jesus spoke this parable to them saying
which one of you if he has a hundred sheep and then loses one of them will not leave the ninetynine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it
then when he has found it he lays it across his shoulders and rejoices 
when he comes to the house he calls together his friends and his neighbors saying to them rejoice with me for i have found my lost sheep
i say to you that even so there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents more than over ninetynine righteous persons who do not need to repent 
or what woman who has ten silver coins if she were to lose one coin would not light a lamp sweep the house and seek diligently until she has found it
when she has found it she calls together her friends and neighbors saying rejoice with me for i have found the coin which i lost
even so i say to you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner who repents 
then jesus said a certain man had two sons
and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of the wealth that falls to me so he divided his property between them 
not many days later the younger son gathered together all he owned and went to a country far away and there he wasted all his wealth by living recklessly
now when he had spent everything a severe famine spread through that country and he began to be in need 
he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country who sent him into his fields to feed pigs
he was longing to eat the carob pods that the pigs ate because no one gave him anything 
but when the young son came to himself he said how many of my fathers hired servants have more than enough bread and i am here perishing from hunger
i will get up and leave here and go to my father and will say to him father i have sinned against heaven and against you
i am no longer worthy to be called your son make me as one of your hired servants 
so the young son got up and left and came toward his father while he was still far away his father saw him and was moved with compassion and he ran and embraced him and kissed him
the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and against you i am no longer worthy to be called your son 
the father said to his servants bring quickly the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet
then bring the fattened calf and kill it let us feast and be merry
for my son was dead and now he is alive he was lost and now he is found then they began to be merry 
now his older son was out in the field as he came and approached the house he heard music and dancing
he called to one of the servants and asked what these things might be
the servant said to him your brother has come home and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him in good health 
the older son was angry and would not go in and his father came out and pleaded with him
but the older son answered and said to his father look these many years i slaved for you and i never neglected a command of yours and yet you never gave me a young goat that i might be merry with my friends
but when your son came who has devoured your living with prostitutes you killed for him the fattened calf 
the father said to him child you are always with me and all that is mine is yours
but it was proper for us to be merry and rejoice for this brother of yours was dead and is now alive he was lost and has now been found  
jesus also said to the disciples there was a certain rich man who had a manager and it was reported to him that this manager was wasting his possessions
so the rich man called him and said to him what is this that i hear about you give an account of your management for you can no longer be manager 
the manager said to himself what should i do since my master is taking away my management job i do not have strength to dig and i am ashamed to beg
i know what i will do so that when i am removed from my management job people will welcome me into their houses 
then the manager called for each one of his masters debtors and he asked the first one how much do you owe to my master
he said a hundred baths of olive oil he said to him take your bill sit down quickly and write fifty
then the manager said to another how much do you owe he said a hundred cors of wheat he said to him take your bill and write eighty 
the master then commended the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly for the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own people than are the sons of light
i say to you make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth so that when it is gone they may welcome you into the eternal dwellings 
he who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much and he who is unrighteous in very little is also unrighteous in much
if you have not been faithful in using unrighteous wealth who will trust you with true wealth
if you have not been faithful in using other peoples property who will give you money of your own 
no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other you cannot serve god and wealth 
now the pharisees who were lovers of money heard all these things and they ridiculed him
he said to them you justify yourselves in the sight of men but god knows your hearts that which is exalted among men is detestable in the sight of god 
the law and the prophets were in effect until john came from that time on the gospel of the kingdom of god is preached and everyone tries to force their way into it
but it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the law to become invalid 
everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery and he who marries one who is divorced from her husband commits adultery 
now there was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and was enjoying every day his great wealth
a certain beggar named lazarus was laid at his gate covered with sores
and longing to eat what fell from the rich mans table even the dogs came and licked his sores 
it came about that the beggar died and was carried away by the angels to abrahams side the rich man also died and was buried
and in hades being in torment he lifted up his eyes and saw abraham far away and lazarus at his side 
so he cried out and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am in anguish in this flame 
but abraham said child remember that in your lifetime you received your good things and lazarus in like manner evil things but now he is comforted here and you are in agony
besides all this a great chasm has been put in place so that those who want to cross over from here to you cannot and no one can cross over from there to us 
the rich man said i beg you father abraham that you would send him to my fathers house
for i have five brothersin order that he may warn them so that it may not be that they come into this place of torment 
but abraham said they have moses and the prophets let them listen to them
the rich man replied no father abraham but if someone would go to them from the dead they will repent
but abraham said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead  
jesus said to his disciples it is certain there will be stumbling blocks but woe to that person through whom they come
it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble 
watch yourselves if your brother sins rebuke him and if he repents forgive him
if he sins against you seven times in the day and seven times returns to you saying i repent you must forgive him 
the apostles said to the lord increase our faith
the lord said if you had faith like a mustard seed you would say to this mulberry tree be uprooted and be planted in the sea and it would obey you 
but which of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep will say to him when he has come in from the field come immediately and sit down to eat
will he not say to him prepare something for me to eat and put a belt around your clothes and serve me until i have finished eating and drinking then afterward you will eat and drink 
he does not thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded does he
even so you also when you have done everything that you are commanded should say we are unworthy servants we have only done what we ought to do 
it came about that as he traveled to jerusalem he went along the border between samaria and galilee
as he entered into a certain village there he was met by ten men who were lepers they stood far away from him
and they lifted up their voices saying jesus master have mercy on us 
when he saw them he said to them go and show yourselves to the priests as they went away they were cleansed
when one of them saw that he was healed he turned back with a loud voice glorifying god
he fell on his face at jesus feet giving him thanks now he was a samaritan 
then jesus said were not the ten cleansed where are the nine
were there no others who returned to give glory to god except this foreigner
he said to him arise and go your faith has made you well 
being asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god would come jesus answered them and said the kingdom of god does not come with careful observing
neither will they say look here it is or there it is for look the kingdom of god is within you 
he said to the disciples the days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the son of man but you will not see it
then they will say to you look there look here but do not go out or run after them
for as the lightning shines brightly when it flashes from one part of the sky to another part of the sky so will the son of man be in his day 
but first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation
as it happened in the days of noah even so will it also happen in the days of the son of man
they ate they drank they married and they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the arkand the flood came and destroyed them all 
in the same way even as it happened in the days of lotthey were eating and drinking buying and selling planting and building
but in the day that lot went out from sodom it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all 
after the same manner it will be in the day that the son of man is revealed
in that day let him who is on the housetop not go down to get his goods out of the house and in the same way let him who is in the field not return 
remember lots wife
whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it but whoever loses his life will save it 
i tell you in that night there will be two people in one bed one will be taken and the other will be left
there will be two women grinding grain together one will be taken and the other will be left
 luke  the best ancient copies do not have verse  there will be two in the field one will be taken and the other left  
they asked him where lord he said to them where there is a body there will the vultures also be gathered together  
then he spoke a parable to them about how they should always pray and not become discouraged
saying in a certain city there was a judge who did not fear god and did not respect people 
now there was a widow in that city and she came often to him saying help me get justice against my opponent
for a long time he was not willing to help her but after a while he said to himself though i do not fear god or respect man
yet because this widow causes me trouble i will help her get justice so that she does not wear me out by her constant coming 
then the lord said listen to what the unjust judge says
now will not god also bring justice to his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night will he delay long over them
i say to you that he will bring justice to them speedily even so when the son of man comes will he indeed find faith on the earth 
then he also spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and who despised other people
two men went up into the temple to praythe one was a pharisee and the other was a tax collector 
the pharisee stood and prayed these things about himself god i thank you that i am not like other peoplerobbers unrighteous people adulterersor even like this tax collector
i fast two times every week i give tithes of all that i get 
but the tax collector standing at a distance would not even lift up his eyes to heaven but hit his breast saying god have mercy on me a sinner
i say to you this man went back down to his house justified rather than the other because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled but everyone who humbles himself will be exalted 
the people were also bringing to him their infants so that he might touch them but when the disciples saw it they rebuked them
but jesus called them to him saying permit the little children to come to me and do not forbid them for the kingdom of god belongs to such ones
truly i say to you whoever will not receive the kingdom of god like a child will definitely not enter it 
a certain ruler asked him saying good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life
jesus said to him why do you call me good no one is good except god alone
you know the commandmentsdo not commit adultery do not murder do not steal do not testify falsely honor your father and mother
the ruler said all these things i have obeyed from the time i was a youth 
when jesus heard that he said to him one thing you still lack you must sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor and you will have treasure in heavenand come follow me
but when the ruler heard these things he became extremely sad for he was very rich 
then jesus seeing him  some ancient greek copies have the phrase seeing that he had become sad  said how difficult it is for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of god
for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of god 
those hearing it said then who can be saved
jesus answered the things which are impossible with people are possible with god 
peter said well we have left everything that is our own and have followed you
jesus then said to them truly i say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of god
who will not receive much more in this time and in the age to come eternal life 
after he gathered the twelve to himself he said to them see we are going up to jerusalem and all the things that have been written by the prophets about the son of man will be accomplished
for he will be given over to the gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon
after whipping him they will kill him and on the third day he will rise again 
they understood none of these things and this word was hidden from them and they did not understand the things that were said 
it came about that as jesus approached jericho a certain blind man was sitting by the road begging
and hearing a crowd going by he asked what was happening
they told him that jesus of nazareth was passing by 
so the blind man cried out saying jesus son of david have mercy on me
the ones who were walking ahead rebuked the blind man telling him to be quiet but he cried out all the more son of david have mercy on me 
jesus stood still and commanded that the man be brought to him then when the blind man was near jesus asked him
what do you want me to do for you he said lord i want to receive my sight 
jesus said to him receive your sight your faith has healed you
immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god all the people when they saw this gave praise to god  
jesus entered and was passing through jericho
behold there was a man there named zacchaeus he was a chief tax collector and was rich 
he was trying to see who jesus was but could not see over the crowd because he was small in height
so he ran on ahead of the people and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him because jesus was about to pass that way 
when jesus came to the place he looked up and said to him zacchaeus come down quickly for today i must stay at your house
so he hurried and came down and welcomed him joyfully
when everyone saw this they all complained saying he has gone in to visit a man who is a sinner 
zacchaeus stood and said to the lord look lord the half of my possessions i give to the poor and if i have cheated anyone of anything i will restore four times the amount
jesus said to him today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of abraham
for the son of man came to seek and to save the people who are lost 
as they heard these things he continued speaking and told a parable because he was near to jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of god was about to appear immediately
he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then to return 
he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas and said to them conduct business until i come back
but his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him saying we will not have this man reign over us
it happened when he returned having received the kingdom he commanded the servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him that he might know what profit they had made by doing business 
the first came before him saying lord your mina has made ten minas more
the nobleman said to him well done good servant because you were faithful in very little you will have authority over ten cities 
the second came saying your mina lord has made five minas
the nobleman said to him you take charge over five cities 
another came saying lord here is your mina which i kept safely in a cloth
for i was afraid of you because you are a demanding person you take up what you did not put in and you reap what you did not sow 
the nobleman said to him by your own words i will judge you you wicked servant you knew that i am a demanding person taking up what i did not put in and reaping what i did not sow
then why did you not put my money in the bank so that when i returned i would have collected it with interest 
the nobleman said to them that stood by take away from him the mina and give it to him that has the ten minas
they said to him lord he has ten minas 
i say to you that everyone who has will be given more but from him that has not even that which he has will be taken away
but these enemies of mine those who did not want me to reign over them bring them here and kill them before me 
when he had said these things he went on ahead going up to jerusalem 
it came about that when he came near to bethphage and bethany to the mountain that is called olives he sent two of the disciples
saying go into the next village as you enter you will find a colt that has never been ridden untie it and bring it to me
if anyone asks you why are you untying it say the lord has need of it 
those who were sent went and found the colt just as jesus had told them
as they were untying the colt the owners said to them why are you untying the colt
they said the lord has need of it
they brought it to jesus and they threw their cloaks upon the colt and set jesus on it
as he went they spread their cloaks on the road 
as he was now approaching the place where the mount of olives descends the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen saying
blessed is the king who comes in the name of the lord  peace in heaven and glory in the highest 
some of the pharisees in the multitude said to him teacher rebuke your disciples
jesus answered and said i tell you if these were silent the stones would cry out 
when jesus approached the city he wept over it
saying if only you had known in this day even you the things which bring you peace but now they are hidden from your eyes 
for the days will come upon you when your enemies will build a barricade around you and surround you and press in on you from every side
they will strike you down to the ground and your children with you they will not leave one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation 
jesus entered the temple and began to cast out those who were selling
saying to them it is written my house will be a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers 
so jesus was teaching daily in the temple the chief priests and the scribes were seeking to destroy him as were the leaders of the people
but they could not find a way to do it because all the people were listening to him intently  
it came about one day as jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel that the chief priests and the scribes came to him with the elders
they spoke saying to him tell us by what authority you do these things or who it is who gave you this authority 
he answered and said to them i will also ask you a question and you tell me
the baptism of john was it from heaven or from men 
they reasoned with themselves saying if we say from heaven he will say then why did you not believe him
but if we say from men all the people will stone us for they are persuaded that john was a prophet 
so they answered that they did not know where it came from
jesus said to them neither will i tell you by what authority i do these things 
he told the people this parable a man planted a vineyard rented it out to vine growers and went into another country for a long time
at the appointed time he sent a servant to the vine growers that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the vine growers beat him and sent him away emptyhanded 
he then sent yet another servant and they also beat him treated him shamefully and sent him away emptyhanded
he also sent yet a third and they also wounded him and threw him out 
so the lord of the vineyard said what will i do i will send my beloved son maybe they will respect him
but when the vine growers saw him they discussed among themselves saying this is the heir let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours 
they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him what then will the lord of the vineyard do to them
he will come and destroy these vine growers and will give the vineyard to others when they heard it they said may it never be 
but jesus looked at them and said what is the meaning of that which is written the stone that the builders rejected  has become the cornerstone
everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces and the one on whom it falls will be crushed 
so the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them but they were afraid of the people
watching him carefully they sent out spies who pretended to be righteous that they might find fault with his speech so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor 
they asked him saying teacher we know that you say and teach rightly and are not partial to anyone but you teach the truth about the way of god
is it lawful for us to pay taxes to caesar or not 
but jesus understood their craftiness and said to them
show me a denarius whose image and name is on it they said caesars 
he said to them then give to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods
they were not able to find fault with what he had said in front of the people but marveling at his answer they were silent 
when some of the sadducees came to him the ones who say that there is no resurrection
they asked him saying teacher moses wrote to us that if a mans brother dies having a wife and being childless the man should take the brothers wife and raise up children for his brother 
there were seven brothers and the first took a wife and died childless
and the second as well
the third took her and in the same way the seven also left no children and died
afterward the woman also died
in the resurrection then whose wife will she be for the seven had her as their wife 
jesus said to them the sons of this age marry and are given in marriage
but those who are regarded as worthy in that age to receive the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage
neither can they die anymore for they are equal to the angels and are sons of god being sons of the resurrection 
but that the dead are raised even moses showed in the place concerning the bush where he calls the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob
now he is not the god of the dead but of the living because all live to him 
some of the scribes answered teacher you have answered well
for they did not dare ask him any more questions 
jesus said to them how do they say that the christ is davids son
for david himself says in the book of psalms the lord said to my lord  sit at my right hand
until i make your enemies  your footstool
david therefore calls the christ lord so how is he davids son 
in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples
beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes and love special greetings in the marketplaces and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at feasts
they also devour widows houses and for a show they make long prayers men like this will receive greater condemnation  
jesus looked up and saw the rich men who were putting their gifts into the treasury
he saw a certain poor widow putting in two mites
so he said truly i say to you this poor widow put in more than all of them
all of these gave gifts out of their abundance but this widow out of her poverty put in all she had to live on 
as some spoke of the temple how it was decorated with beautiful stones and offerings he said
as for these things that you see the days will come when not one stone will be left on another which will not be torn down 
so they asked him saying teacher when will these things happen what will be the sign when these things are about to happen
jesus answered be careful that you are not deceived for many will come in my name saying i am he and the time is near do not go after them
when you hear of wars and riots do not be terrified for these things must happen first but the end will not happen immediately 
then he said to them nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom
there will be great earthquakes and in various places famines and plagues there will be terrifying events and great signs from heaven 
but before all of these things they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you delivering you over to the synagogues and prisons bringing you before kings and governors because of my name
it will lead to an opportunity for your testimony 
therefore resolve in your hearts not to prepare your defense ahead of time
for i will give you words and wisdom that all your adversaries will not be able to resist or contradict 
but you will be given over also by parents brothers relatives and friends and they will put some of you to death
you will be hated by everyone because of my name
but not a hair from your head will perish
in your endurance you will gain your lives 
when you see jerusalem surrounded by armies then recognize that its desolation is near
then let those in judea flee to the mountains let those who are in the city leave it and those who are out in the country must not enter the city
for these are days of vengeance so that all the things that are written will be fulfilled 
woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing in those days for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people
they will fall by the edge of the sword and they will be led captive into all the nations and jerusalem will be trampled by the gentiles until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled 
there will be signs in the sun in the moon and in the stars and on the earth the nations will be in distress anxious because of the roar of the sea and waves
there will be men fainting from fear and from expectation of the things which are coming upon the world for the powers of the heavens will be shaken 
then they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
but when these things begin to happen stand up and lift up your heads because your redemption is coming near 
jesus told them a parable look at the fig tree and all the trees
when they sprout buds you see for yourselves and know that summer is already near
so also when you see these things happening recognize that the kingdom of god is near 
truly i say to you this generation will not pass away until all these things take place
heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away 
but pay attention to yourselves so that your hearts are not burdened with excessive drinking and drunkenness and the worries of life and that day does not close on you suddenly
like a trap for it will come upon everyone living on the face of the whole earth 
but be alert at all times praying that you may be strong enough to escape all these things that will take place and to stand before the son of man 
so during the days he was teaching in the temple and at night he went out and stayed on the mountain that is called olives
all of the people came early in the morning to hear him in the temple  
now the festival of unleavened bread was approaching which is called the passover
the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they could put jesus to death for they were afraid of the people 
then satan entered into judas the one called iscariot who was one of the twelve
judas went to the chief priests and captains and discussed with them how he would betray jesus to them 
they were glad and agreed to give him money
he consented and looked for an opportunity to give him over to them away from the crowd 
then came the day of unleavened bread on which the passover lamb had to be sacrificed
so jesus sent peter and john saying go and prepare for us the passover meal so that we may eat it
they said to him where do you want us to make preparations 
he answered them look when you have entered the city a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you follow him into the house that he goes into
then say to the master of the house the teacher says to you where is the guest room where i will eat the passover with my disciples 
he will show you a large furnished upper room make the preparations there
so they went and found everything as he had said to them then they prepared the passover meal 
when the hour came he sat down with the apostles
then he said to them i have greatly desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer
for i say to you i will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of god 
then jesus took a cup and when he had given thanks he said take this and share it among yourselves
for i say to you i will not drink of the fruit of the vine again until the kingdom of god comes 
then he took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave to them saying this is my body which is given for you do this in remembrance of me
he took the cup in the same way after supper saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood which is poured out for you 
but pay attention the hand of the one who betrays me is with me at the table
for the son of man indeed goes as it has been determined but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed
they began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who would do this 
then there arose also a quarrel among them about which of them was considered to be greatest
he said to them the kings of the gentiles are lords over them and the ones who have authority over them are called doers of good deeds 
but it must not be like this with you instead let the greatest among you become like the youngest and the one who leads like the one who serves
for who is greater the one who sits at the table or the one who serves is it not the one who sits at the table yet i am among you as one who serves 
but you are the ones who have continued with me in my trials
i set you over a kingdom even as my father has set me over a kingdom
that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel 
simon simon be aware satan asked to have you that he might sift you as wheat
but i have prayed for you that your faith may not fail after you have turned back again strengthen your brothers 
peter said to him lord i am ready to go with you both to prison and to death
jesus replied i tell you peter the rooster will not crow this day before you deny three times that you know me 
then jesus said to them when i sent you out without a purse a bag of provisions or sandals did you lack anything they answered nothing
then he said to them but now the one who has a purse let him take it and likewise a bag of provisions the one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one 
for i say to you what is written about me must be fulfilled he was counted with the lawless ones for what is predicted about me is being fulfilled
then they said lord look here are two swords he said to them it is enough 
jesus went as he often did to the mount of olives and the disciples followed him
when they arrived he said to them pray that you do not enter into temptation 
he went away from them about a stones throw and he knelt down and prayed
saying father if you are willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but yours be done 
then an angel from heaven appeared to him strengthening him
being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground 
when he rose up from his prayer he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of their sorrow
and asked them why are you sleeping rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation 
while he was still speaking behold a crowd appeared with judas one of the twelve leading them he came near to jesus to kiss him
but jesus said to him judas are you betraying the son of man with a kiss 
when those who were around jesus saw what was happening they said lord should we strike with the sword
then one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear
jesus said that is enough he touched his ear and healed him 
jesus said to the chief priests to the captains of the temple and to elders who came against him do you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs
when i was daily with you in the temple you did not lay your hands on me but this is your hour and the authority of darkness 
seizing him they led him away and brought him into the high priests house but peter followed from a distance
after they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together peter sat in the midst of them 
a certain female servant saw him as he sat in the light of the fire and looked straight at him and said this man also was with him
but peter denied it saying woman i do not know him
after a little while someone else saw him and said you are also one of them but peter said man i am not 
after about an hour another man insisted and said truly this man also was with him for he is a galilean
but peter said man i do not know what you are saying immediately while he was speaking a rooster crowed 
turning the lord looked at peter and peter remembered the word of the lord when he said to him before a rooster crows today you will deny me three times
peter went outside and wept bitterly 
then the men holding jesus in custody mocked and beat him
they put a cover over him and asked him saying prophesy who is the one who hit you
they spoke many other things against jesus blaspheming him 
as soon as it was day the elders of the people gathered together both chief priests and scribes they led him into the council
and said if you are the christ tell us but he said to them if i tell you you will not believe
and if i ask you you will not answer 
but from now on the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god
they all said then you are the son of god jesus said to them you say that i am
they said why do we still need a witness for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth  
the whole company of them rose up and brought jesus before pilate
they began to accuse him saying we found this man misleading our nation forbidding to give tribute to caesar and saying that he himself is christ a king 
pilate asked him saying are you the king of the jews jesus answered him and said you say so
pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes i find no guilt in this man
but they were insisting saying he stirs up the people teaching throughout all judea beginning from galilee even to this place 
so when pilate heard this he asked whether the man was a galilean
when he learned that he was under herods authority he sent jesus to herod who himself also was at jerusalem in those days 
when herod saw jesus he was very glad because he had wanted to see him for a long time he had heard about him and he hoped to see some sign done by him
herod questioned jesus in many words but jesus answered him nothing
the chief priests and the scribes stood vigorously accusing him 
herod with his soldiers showed jesus contempt and they mocked him then they dressed him in splendid clothes and sent him back to pilate
for herod and pilate had become friends with each other that very day for before this they had been enemies with each other 
pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the crowd of people
and said to them you brought to me this man like a man who is misleading the people and see i having questioned him before you find no guilt in this man concerning those things of which you accuse him 
no nor does herod for he sent him back to us and see nothing worthy of death has been done by him
i will therefore punish him and release him
 the best ancient copies do not have luke  now pilate was obligated to release to the jews one prisoner at the feast  
but they cried out all together saying away with this man and release to us barabbas
barabbas was a man who had been put into prison for a certain rebellion in the city and for murder 
pilate addressed them again desiring to release jesus
but they shouted saying crucify him crucify him
he said to them a third time why what evil has this man done i have found no guilt deserving death in him therefore after punishing him i will release him 
but they were insistent with loud voices demanding for him to be crucified their voices convinced pilate
so pilate decided to grant their demand
he released the one they asked for who had been put in prison for rebellion and murder but he delivered up jesus to their will 
as they led him away they seized one simon of cyrene coming from the country and they laid the cross on him to carry following jesus 
a great crowd of the people and of women who grieved and mourned for him were following him
but turning to them jesus said daughters of jerusalem do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children 
for see the days are coming in which they will say blessed are the barren and the wombs that did not bear and the breasts that did not nurse
then they will begin to say to the mountains  fall on us and to the hills cover us
for if they do these things while the tree is green what will happen when it is dry 
other men two criminals were led away with him to be put to death 
when they came to the place that is called the skull there they crucified him and the criminalsone on his right and one on his left
jesus said father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing then they cast lots dividing up his garments 
the people stood watching while the rulers also were mocking him saying he saved others let him save himself if he is the christ of god the chosen one 
the soldiers also ridiculed him approaching him offering him vinegar
and saying if you are the king of the jews save yourself
there was also a sign over him this is the king of the jews 
one of the criminals who was hanging there insulted him by saying are you not the christ save yourself and us
but the other rebuked him saying do you not fear god since you are under the same sentence of condemnation
we indeed are here justly for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds but this man did nothing wrong 
then he said jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom
jesus said to him truly i say to you today you will be with me in paradise 
it was now about the sixth hour and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour
as the sun turned dark then the curtain of the temple was split in two 
crying with a loud voice jesus said father into your hands i commit my spirit having said this he died
when the centurion saw what was done he glorified god saying surely this was a righteous man 
when all the multitudes who came together to witness this sight saw the things that were done they returned beating their breasts
but all those who knew him and the women who followed him from galilee stood at a distance watching these things 
behold there was a man named joseph who was a member of the council he was a good and righteous man
this man had not agreed with their plan and action he was from arimathea a city of the jews and he was looking for the kingdom of god 
this man approaching pilate asked for the body of jesus
he took it down wrapped it in fine linen and placed it in a tomb that was cut in stone where no one had ever been laid 
it was the day of the preparation and the sabbath was about to begin
the women who had come with jesus out of galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid
they returned and prepared spices and ointments then on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment  
very early on the first day of the week they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared
they found the stone rolled away from the tomb
they entered in but did not find the body of the lord jesus 
it happened that while they were confused about this suddenly two men stood by them in bright shining garments
as the women were terrified and bowed down their faces to the earth they said to the women why do you seek the living among the dead 
he is not here but has been raised remember how he spoke to you when he was still in galilee
saying that the son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise again 
the women remembered his words
and returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and all the rest
now mary magdalene joanna mary the mother of james and the other women with them reported these things to the apostles 
but this message seemed like idle talk to the apostles and they did not believe the women
yet peter rose up and ran to the tomb and stooping and looking in he saw the linen cloths by themselves peter then departed to his home wondering what had happened 
behold two of them were going that very day to a village named emmaus which was sixty stadia from jerusalem
they discussed with each other about all the things that had happened 
it happened that while they discussed and questioned together jesus himself approached and went with them
but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him 
jesus said to them what are these matters you two are discussing as you walk they stood there looking sad
one of them named cleopas answered him are you the only person in jerusalem who does not know the things which have happened there these days 
jesus said to them what things they answered him the things concerning jesus the nazarene who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death and crucified him 
but we hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem israel yes and what is more it is now the third day since all these things happened 
but also some women of our company amazed us having been at the tomb early in the morning
when they did not find his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive
some men who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said but they did not see him 
jesus said to them o foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken
was it not necessary for the christ to suffer these things and to enter into his glory
then beginning from moses and through all the prophets jesus interpreted to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures 
as they approached the village to which they were going jesus acted as though he were going further
but they compelled him saying stay with us for it is toward evening and the day is almost over so jesus went in to stay with them 
it happened that when he had sat down with them to eat he took the bread blessed it and breaking it he gave it to them
then their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight
they said one to another was not our heart burning within us while he spoke to us on the way while he opened to us the scriptures 
they rose up that very hour and returned to jerusalem they found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them
saying the lord is risen indeed and has appeared to simon
so they told the things that happened on the way and how jesus was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread 
as they spoke these things jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said to them peace be to you
but they were terrified and filled with fear and thought that they were seeing a spirit 
jesus said to them why are you troubled why do questions arise in your heart
see my hands and my feet that it is i myself touch me and see for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see me having
when he had said this he showed them his hands and his feet 
they still could not believe it because of joy and they were amazed jesus said to them do you have anything to eat
they gave him a piece of a broiled fish
and he took it and ate it before them 
he said to them these are my words that i spoke to you when i was with you that all that was written in the law of moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled 
then he opened their minds that they might understand the scriptures
he said to them thus it is written that the christ should suffer and rise again from the dead on the third day
repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning from jerusalem 
you are witnesses of these things
see i am sending you what my father promised but remain in the city until you are clothed with power from on high 
then jesus led them out until they were near bethany he lifted up his hands and blessed them
it happened that while he was blessing them he left them and was carried up into heaven 
so they worshiped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy
they were continually in the temple, blessing god.
in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
this one was in the beginning with god
all things were made through him and without him there was not one thing made that has been made 
in him was life and the life was the light of men
the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not overcome it 
there was a man who was sent from god whose name was john
he came as a witness to testify about the light that all might believe through him
john was not the light but came that he might testify about the light 
the true light which gives light to all men was coming into the world 
he was in the world and the world was made through him and the world did not know him
he came to his own and his own did not receive him 
but to as many as received him who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of god
these were not born of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god 
the word became flesh and lived among us we have seen his glory glory as of the one and only who came from the father full of grace and truth
john testified about him and cried out saying this was the one of whom i said he who comes after me is greater than i am for he was before me 
for from his fullness we have all received grace after grace
for the law was given through moses grace and truth came through jesus christ
no one has ever seen god the only god who is at the fathers side he has made god known 
this is the testimony of john when the jews sent priests and levites to him from jerusalem to ask him who are you
he confessedhe did not deny but confessedi am not the christ
so they asked him what are you then are you elijah he said i am not they said are you the prophet he answered no 
then they said to him who are you so that we may give an answer to those who sent us what do you say about yourself
he said i am a voice crying in the wilderness make the way of the lord straight just as isaiah the prophet said 
now some from the pharisees were sent
and they asked him and said to him why do you baptize then if you are not the christ nor elijah nor the prophet 
john answered them saying i baptize with water but among you stands someone you do not know
he is the one who comes after me the strap of whose sandal i am not worthy to untie
these things were done in bethany on the other side of the jordan where john was baptizing 
the next day john saw jesus coming to him and said look there is the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world
this is the one of whom i said the one who comes after me is more than me for he was before me
i did not know him but it was so that he could be revealed to israel that i came baptizing with water 
john testified saying i saw the spirit coming down like a dove from heaven and it stayed upon him
i did not recognize him but he who sent me to baptize in water said to me the one on whom you see the spirit come down and remain he is the one who will baptize with the holy spirit
i have both seen and testified that this is the son of god 
again the next day as john was standing with two of his disciples
they saw jesus walking by and john said look the lamb of god 
his two disciples heard him say this and they followed jesus
then jesus turned and saw them following him and said to them what are you looking for they replied rabbi which is translated teacher where are you staying
he said to them come and see then they came and saw where he was staying they stayed with him that day for it was about the tenth hour 
one of the two who heard john speak and then followed jesus was andrew the brother of simon peter
he first found his own brother simon and said to him we have found the messiah which is translated christ
he brought him to jesus and jesus looked at him and said you are simon son of john you will be called cephas which is translated peter 
the next day when jesus wanted to leave to go to galilee he found philip and said to him follow me
now philip was from bethsaida the city of andrew and peter
philip found nathaniel and said to him he of whom moses wrote in the law and the prophets we have found him jesus son of joseph from nazareth 
nathaniel said to him can any good thing come out of nazareth philip said to him come and see
jesus saw nathaniel coming to him and said about him see a true israelite in whom is no deceit
nathaniel said to him how do you know me jesus answered and said to him before philip called you when you were under the fig tree i saw you 
nathaniel replied rabbi you are the son of god you are the king of israel
jesus replied and said to him because i said to you i saw you underneath the fig tree do you believe you will see greater things than this
then he said truly truly i say to you you will see the heavens opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man  
three days later there was a wedding in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there
jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding 
when the wine ran out the mother of jesus said to him they have no wine
jesus said to her woman why do you come to me my time has not yet come
his mother said to the servants whatever he says to you do it 
now there were six stone water pots there used for the jewish ceremonial washing each containing two to three metretes
jesus said to them fill the water pots with water so they filled them up to the brim
then he told the servants take some out now and take it to the head waiter so they did 
the head waiter tasted the water that had become wine but he did not know where it came from but the servants who had drawn the water knew then he called the bridegroom
and said to him every man serves the good wine first and then the cheaper wine when they are drunk but you have kept the good wine until now 
this first sign jesus did in cana of galilee and he revealed his glory and his disciples believed in him 
after this jesus his mother his brothers and his disciples went down to capernaum and they stayed there for a few days 
now the passover of the jews was near and jesus went up to jerusalem
he found sellers of oxen and sheep and pigeons in the temple and the money changers were sitting there 
so he made a whip of cords and drove all of them out from the temple including both the sheep and the cattle he scattered the coins of the money changers and turned their tables over
to the pigeon sellers he said take these things away from here stop making the house of my father a marketplace 
his disciples remembered that it was written zeal for your house will consume me
then the jewish authorities responded and said to him what sign will you show us since you are doing these things
jesus replied destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up 
then the jewish authorities said this temple was built in fortysix years and you will raise it up in three days
however he was speaking about the temple of his body
after he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he said this and they believed the scripture and this statement that jesus had spoken 
now when he was in jerusalem at the passover festival many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he did
but jesus did not trust in them because he knew them all
because he did not need anyone to testify to him about man for he knew what was in man  
now there was a pharisee whose name was nicodemus a jewish leader
this man came to jesus at night and said to him rabbi we know that you are a teacher that came from god for no one can do these signs that you do unless god is with him 
jesus replied to him truly truly unless someone is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
nicodemus said to him how can a man be born when he is old he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born can he 
jesus replied truly truly unless someone is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit 
do not be amazed that i said to you you must be born again
the wind blows wherever it wishes you hear its sound but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going so is everyone who is born of the spirit 
nicodemus replied and said to him how can these things be
jesus answered and said to him are you a teacher of israel and yet you do not understand these things
truly truly i say to you we speak what we know and we testify about what we have seen yet you do not accept our testimony 
if i told you about earthly things and you do not believe how will you believe if i tell you about heavenly things
no one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaventhe son of man 
just as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up
so that all who believe in him may have eternal life 
for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life
for god did not send the son into the world in order to condemn the world but in order to save the world through him
he who believes in him is not condemned but he who does not believe is already condemned because he has not believed in the name of the only son of god 
this is the reason for the judgment the light has come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil
for everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light so that his deeds will not be exposed
however he who practices the truth comes to the light so that it may be plainly seen that his deeds have been done in god 
after this jesus and his disciples went into the land of judea there he spent some time with them and baptized
now john was also baptizing in aenon near to salim because there was much water there people were coming to him and were being baptized
for john had not yet been thrown in prison 
then there arose a dispute between some of johns disciples and a jew about ceremonial washing
they went to john and said to him rabbi the one who was with you on the other side of the jordan river about whom you have testified look he is baptizing and they are all going to him 
john replied a man cannot receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven
you yourselves can testify that i said i am not the christ but instead i have been sent before him 
the bride belongs to the bridegroom now the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly because of the voice of the bridegroom this then is my joy made complete
he must increase but i must decrease 
he who comes from above is above all he who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks about the earth he who comes from heaven is above all
he testifies about what he has seen and heard but no one accepts his testimony
he who has received his testimony has confirmed that god is true 
for the one whom god has sent speaks the words of god for he does not give the spirit by measure
the father loves the son and has given all things into his hand
he who believes in the son has eternal life but the one who disobeys the son will not see life but the wrath of god stays on him  
now when jesus knew that the pharisees had heard that he was making and baptizing more disciples than john
although jesus himself was not baptizing but his disciples were
he left judea and went back again to galilee 
but it was necessary for him to go through samaria
so he came to a town of samaria called sychar near the piece of land that jacob had given to his son joseph 
the well of jacob was there jesus was tired from his journey and sat by the well it was about the sixth hour
a samaritan woman came to draw water and jesus said to her give me some water to drink
for his disciples had gone away into the town to buy food 
then the samaritan woman said to him how is it that you being a jew are asking me being a samaritan woman for something to drink for jews have no dealings with samaritans
jesus answered and said to her if you had known the gift of god and who it is that is saying to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water 
the woman said to him sir you do not have a bucket and the well is deep where then do you have the living water
you are not greater are you than our father jacob who gave us the well and drank from it himself as did his sons and his livestock 
jesus replied and said to her everyone who drinks from this water will be thirsty again
but whoever drinks from the water that i will give him will not ever be thirsty again instead the water that i will give him will become a fountain of water in him springing up to eternal life 
the woman said to him sir give me this water so that i may not become thirsty and not have to come here to draw water
jesus said to her go call your husband and come back here 
the woman answered and said to him i do not have a husband jesus replied you have said correctly i have no husband
for you have had five husbands and the one you now have is not your husband what you have said is true 
the woman said to him sir i see that you are a prophet
our fathers worshiped on this mountain but you say that jerusalem is the place where people have to worship 
jesus said to her believe me woman that an hour is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem
you worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the jews 
however the hour is coming and is now here when true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father is seeking such people to be his worshipers
god is spirit and the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth 
the woman said to him i know that the messiah is coming the one called christ when he comes he will explain everything to us
jesus said to her i am he the one speaking to you 
at that moment his disciples returned now they were wondering why he was speaking with a woman but no one said what are you looking for or why are you speaking with her 
so the woman left her water pot went back to the town and said to the people
come see a man who told me everything that i have ever done this could not be the christ could it
they left the town and came to him 
in the meantime the disciples were urging him saying rabbi eat
but he said to them i have food to eat that you do not know about
so the disciples said to each other no one has brought him anything to eat have they 
jesus said to them my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work
do you not say there are four more months and then the harvest comes i am saying to you look up and see the fields for they are already ripe for harvest
he who is harvesting receives wages and gathers fruit for everlasting life so that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together 
for in this the saying one sows and another reaps is true
i sent you to reap what you have not worked for others have labored and you have entered into their labor 
many of the samaritans in that city believed in him because of the report of the woman who was testifying he told me everything that i have done
so when the samaritans came to him they asked him to stay with them and he stayed there two days 
many more believed because of his word
they said to the woman we no longer believe because of what you said for we ourselves have heard and we know that this one is indeed the savior of the world 
after those two days he departed from there for galilee
for jesus himself declared that a prophet has no honor in his own country
when he came into galilee the galileans welcomed him they had seen all the things that he had done in jerusalem at the festival for they had also gone to the festival 
now he came again to cana in galilee where he had made the water wine there was a certain royal official whose son in capernaum was ill
when he heard that jesus had come from judea to galilee he went to jesus and asked him to come down and heal his son who was about to die 
jesus then said to him unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe
the royal official said to him sir come down before my child dies
jesus said to him go your son lives the man believed the word that jesus spoke to him and he went away 
while he was going down his servants met him saying that his son was living
so he asked them the hour when he began to improve they replied to him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him 
then the father realized that it was at that hour that jesus had said to him your son lives so he himself and his whole household believed
this was the second sign that jesus did when he came out of judea to galilee  
after this there was a jewish festival and jesus went up to jerusalem
now in jerusalem by the sheep gate there is a pool which in the aramaic language is called bethesda and it has five roofed porches
a large number of people who were sick blind lame or paralyzed were lying there  the best ancient copies do not have the phrase waiting for the moving of the water 
 the best ancient copies do not have verse  for an angel of the lord went down and stirred up the water at certain times and whoever stepped in while the water was stirring was healed from whatever disease he suffered from  
a certain man was there who had been sick for thirtyeight years
when jesus saw him lying there and after he realized that he had been there a long time he said to him do you want to be healthy 
the sick man replied sir i do not have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up when i come another steps down before me
jesus said to him get up take up your bed and walk 
immediately the man was healed and he took up his bed and walked now that day was a sabbath 
so the jews said to him who was healed it is the sabbath and you are not permitted to carry your mat
he replied he who made me healthy said to me pick up your mat and walk 
they asked him who is the man that said to you pick it up and walk
however the one who was healed did not know who it was because jesus had gone away secretly for there was a crowd in the place 
afterward jesus found him in the temple and said to him see you have become healthy do not sin anymore so that something worse will not happen to you
the man went away and reported to the jews that it was jesus who had made him healthy 
now because of these things the jews persecuted jesus because he did these things on the sabbath
jesus replied to them my father is working even now and i too am working
because of this the jews sought even more to kill him because he not only broke the sabbath but also called god his own father making himself equal to god 
jesus answered them truly truly the son can do nothing of himself except only what he sees the father doing for whatever the father is doing the son does in the same way
for the father loves the son and he shows him everything that he himself does and he will show him greater works than these so that you will be amazed 
for as the father raises the dead and gives them life so also the son gives life to anyone he wishes
for the father judges no one but he has given all judgment to the son
so that everyone will honor the son just as they honor the father the one who does not honor the son does not honor the father who sent him 
truly truly he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned but he has passed from death to life 
truly truly i tell you the time is coming and is now when the dead will hear the voice of the son of god and those who hear will live 
for just as the father has life in himself so he has also given to the son so that he has life in himself
and the father has given the son authority to carry out judgment because he is the son of man 
do not be amazed at this for there is a time coming in which everyone who is in the tombs will hear his voice
and will come out those who have done good to the resurrection of life and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment 
i can do nothing from myself as i hear i judge and my judgment is righteous because i am not seeking my own will but the will of him who sent me
if i should testify about myself my testimony would not be true
there is another who testifies about me and i know that the testimony that he gives about me is true 
you have sent to john and he has testified to the truth
but the testimony that i receive is not from man i say these things that you might be saved
john was a lamp that was burning and shining and you were willing to rejoice in his light for a while 
yet the testimony that i have is greater than that of john for the works that the father has given me to accomplish the very works that i do testify about me that the father has sent me
the father who sent me has himself testified about me you have neither heard his voice nor seen his form at any time
you do not have his word remaining in you for you are not believing in the one whom he has sent 
you search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and these same scriptures testify about me
and you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life 
i do not receive glory from men
but i know that you do not have the love of god in yourselves 
i have come in my fathers name and you do not receive me if another should come in his own name you would receive him
how can you believe you who accept glory from one another but are not seeking the glory that comes from the only god 
do not think that i myself will accuse you before the father the one who accuses you is moses in whom you have hoped
if you believed moses you would believe me because he wrote about me
if you do not believe his writings how are you going to believe my words  
after these things jesus went away to the other side of the sea of galilee also called the sea of tiberias
a great crowd was following him because they saw the signs that he was doing on those who were sick
jesus went up the mountain and there he sat down with his disciples 
now the passover the jewish festival was near
when jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming to him he said to philip where are we going to buy bread so that these may eat
but jesus said this to test philip for he himself knew what he was going to do 
philip answered him two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be sufficient for each one to have even a little
one of the disciples andrew the brother of simon peter said to jesus
there is a boy here who has five loaves of barley bread and two fish but what are these among so many 
jesus said make the people sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down about five thousand in number
then jesus took the loaves and after giving thanks he gave it to those who were sitting he did the same with the fish as much as they wanted
when the people were filled he said to his disciples gather up the broken pieces which remain so that nothing will be lost 
so they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten
then when the people saw this sign that he did they said this truly is the prophet who is to come into the world
when jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him by force to make him king he withdrew again up the mountain by himself 
when it became evening his disciples went down to the sea
they got into a boat and were going over the sea to capernaum it was dark by this time and jesus had not yet come to them
a strong wind was blowing and the sea was getting rough 
when they had rowed about twentyfive or thirty stadia they saw jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat and they were afraid
but he said to them it is i do not be afraid
then they were willing to receive him into the boat and immediately the boat reached the land where they were going 
the next day the crowd that had been standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except the one and that jesus had not entered it with his disciples but that his disciples had gone away alone
however there were some boats that came from tiberias close to the place where they had eaten the bread loaves after the lord had given thanks 
when the crowd discovered that neither jesus nor his disciples were there they themselves got into the boats and went to capernaum seeking jesus
after they found him on the other side of the sea they said to him rabbi when did you come here 
jesus replied to them saying truly truly you seek me not because you saw signs but because you ate some of the bread loaves and were filled
do not labor for the food that perishes but labor for the food that endures to eternal life which the son of man will give you for god the father has set his seal on him 
then they said to him what must we do so that we may do the works of god
jesus replied and said to them this is the work of god that you believe in the one whom he has sent 
so they said to him what sign then will you do so that we may see and believe you what will you do
our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat 
then jesus replied to them truly truly it was not moses who gave you the bread out of heaven but it is my father who is giving you the true bread from heaven
for the bread of god is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world
so they said to him sir give us this bread always 
jesus said to them i am the bread of life he who comes to me will not be hungry and he who believes in me will never be thirsty
but i told you that indeed you have seen me and you do not believe
everyone whom the father gives me will come to me and he who comes to me i will certainly not throw out 
for i have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me
this is the will of him who sent me that i would lose not one of all those whom he has given me but will raise them up on the last day
for this is the will of my father that everyone who sees the son and believes in him will have eternal life and i will raise him up on the last day 
then the jews grumbled about him because he had said i am the bread that has come down from heaven
they said is not this jesus son of joseph whose father and mother we know how then does he now say i have come down from heaven 
jesus replied and said to them stop grumbling among yourselves
no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and i will raise him up on the last day
it is written in the prophets everyone will be taught by god everyone who has heard and learned from the father comes to me 
not that anyone has seen the father except he who is from godhe has seen the father
truly truly he who believes has eternal life 
i am the bread of life
your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died 
this is the bread which comes down from heaven so that a person may eat some of it and not die
i am the living bread that came down from heaven if anyone eats some of this bread he will live forever the bread that i will give is my flesh for the life of the world 
the jews became angry among themselves and began to argue saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat
then jesus said to them truly truly unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you will not have life in yourselves 
whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day
for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink
he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and i in him 
as the living father sent me and as i live because of the father so he who eats me he will also live because of me
this is the bread that has come down from heaven not as the fathers ate and died he who eats this bread will live forever
but jesus said these things in the synagogue while he was teaching in capernaum 
then many of his disciples who heard this said this is a difficult saying who can hear it
jesus because he knew in himself that his disciples were grumbling at this said to them does this offend you 
then what if you should see the son of man going up to where he was before
it is the spirit who makes alive the flesh profits nothing the words that i have spoken to you are spirit and they are life 
yet there are some of you who do not believe for jesus knew from the beginning who were the ones that would not believe and who it was who would betray him
he said it is because of this that i said to you that no one can come to me unless it is granted to him by the father 
because of this many of his disciples went away and no longer walked with him
then jesus said to the twelve you do not want to go away also do you
simon peter answered him lord to whom would we go you have words of eternal life
and we have believed and come to know that you are the holy one of god  the phrase the holy one of god is in the best ancient copies some later copies add an additional description and they read the christ the holy one of god  
jesus said to them did not i choose you the twelve and one of you is a devil
now he spoke of judas son of simon iscariot for it was he one of the twelve who would betray jesus  
after these things jesus traveled about in galilee for he did not want to go into judea because the jews were seeking to kill him
now the jewish festival of shelters was near 
his brothers therefore said to him leave this place and go to judea so that your disciples also may see the works that you do
no one does anything in secret if he himself seeks to be known openly if you do these things show yourself to the world 
for even his brothers did not believe in him
jesus therefore said to them my time has not yet come but your time is always ready
the world cannot hate you but it hates me because i testify about it that its works are evil 
you go up to the festival i am not going to this festival because my time has not yet been fulfilled
after he said these things to them he stayed in galilee 
but when his brothers had gone up to the festival then he also went up not publicly but in secret
the jews were looking for him at the festival and said where is he 
there was much discussion among the crowds about him some said he is a good man others said no he leads the crowds astray
yet no one spoke openly about him for fear of the jews 
when the festival was already half over jesus went up into the temple and began to teach
then the jews marveled saying how does this man know so much he has never been educated
jesus answered them and said my teaching is not mine but is of him who sent me 
if anyone wishes to do his will he will know about this teaching whether it comes from god or whether i speak from myself
whoever speaks from himself seeks his own glory but whoever seeks the glory of him who sent him that person is true and there is no unrighteousness in him 
did not moses give you the law yet none of you keeps the law why do you seek to kill me
the crowd answered you have a demon who seeks to kill you 
jesus answered and said to them i did one work and you all marvel because of it
moses gave you circumcision not that it is from moses but from the ancestors and on the sabbath you circumcise a man 
if a man receives circumcision on the sabbath so that the law of moses is not broken why are you angry with me because i made a man completely healthy on the sabbath
do not judge according to appearance but judge righteously 
some of them from jerusalem said is not this the one they seek to kill
see he speaks openly and they say nothing to him it cannot be that the rulers indeed know that this is the christ can it
yet we know where this one is from but when the christ comes no one will know where he is from 
then jesus cried out in the temple teaching and saying you both know me and know where i come from i have not come of myself but he who sent me is true and you do not know him
i know him because i come from him and he sent me 
they were trying to arrest him but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come
but many in the crowd believed in him and they said when the christ comes will he do more signs than what this one has done
the pharisees heard the crowds whispering these things about jesus and the chief priests and the pharisees sent officers to arrest him 
jesus then said i am still with you for a short amount of time and then i go to him who sent me
you will seek me but you will not find me where i go you will not be able to come 
the jews therefore said among themselves where will this man go that we will not be able to find him will he go to the dispersion among the greeks and teach the greeks
what is this word that he said you will seek me but will not find me where i go you will not be able to come 
now on the last great day of the festival jesus stood and cried out saying if anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink
he who believes in me just as the scripture says rivers of living water will flow from his belly 
but he said this about the spirit whom those who believed in him would receive the spirit had not yet been given because jesus was not yet glorified 
some of the crowd when they heard these words said this is indeed the prophet
others said this is the christ but some said does the christ come from galilee
have the scriptures not said that the christ will come from the descendants of david and from bethlehem the village where david was 
so there arose a division in the crowds because of him
some of them would have arrested him but no one laid hands on him 
then the officers came back to the chief priests and pharisees who said to them why did you not bring him
the officers answered never has anyone spoken like this 
so the pharisees answered them have you also been deceived
have any of the rulers believed in him or any of the pharisees
but this crowd that does not know the law they are cursed 
nicodemus one of the pharisees who came to him earlier said to them
does our law judge a man before hearing from him and knowing what he does
they answered and said to him are you also from galilee search and see that no prophet comes from galilee 
 the best ancient copies do not have john  then everyone went to his own house  
 see the note on john  jesus went to the mount of olives
early in the morning he came to the temple again and all the people came he sat down and taught them
the scribes and the pharisees brought a woman caught in the act of adultery they placed her in the middle 
then they said to him teacher this woman has been caught in the act of adultery
now in the law moses commanded us to stone such people what do you say about her
they said this in order to trap him so that they might have something to accuse him about but jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger 
when they continued asking him questions he stood up and said to them the one among you who has no sin let him be the first to throw a stone at her
again he stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger 
when they heard it they left one by one beginning with the oldest finally jesus was left alone with the woman who had been in the middle
jesus stood up and said to her woman where are your accusers did no one condemn you
she said no one lord jesus said neither do i condemn you go and sin no more  see the note on john  
again jesus spoke to them saying i am the light of the world he who follows me will not walk in the darkness but will have the light of life
the pharisees said to him you testify about yourself your testimony is not true 
jesus answered and said to them even if i testify about myself my testimony is true i know where i came from and where i am going but you do not know where i came from or where i am going
you judge according to the flesh i judge no one
yet if i judge my judgment is true because i am not alone but i am with the father who sent me 
yes and in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true
i am he who testifies about myself and the father who sent me testifies about me 
they said to him where is your father jesus answered you know neither me nor my father if you had known me you would have known my father also
he said these words in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come 
so again he said to them i am going away you will seek me and will die in your sin where i am going you cannot come
the jews said will he kill himself is that why he says where i am going you cannot come 
jesus said to them you are from below i am from above you are of this world i am not of this world
therefore i said to you that you will die in your sins for unless you believe that i am you will die in your sins 
they said therefore to him who are you jesus said to them what i have said to you from the beginning
i have many things to speak and to judge about you however he who sent me is true and the things that i heard from him these things i say to the world
they did not understand that he was speaking to them about the father 
jesus said when you have lifted up the son of man then you will know that i am and that i do nothing of myself as the father taught me i speak these things
he who sent me is with me and he has not left me alone because i always do what is pleasing to him
as jesus was saying these things many believed in him 
jesus said to those jews who had believed him if you remain in my word then you are truly my disciples
and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
they answered him we are descendants of abraham and have never been slaves of anyone how can you say you will be set free 
jesus answered them truly truly i say to you everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin
the slave does not remain in the house forever the son remains forever
therefore if the son sets you free you will be truly free 
i know that you are abrahams descendants you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you
i say what i have seen with my father and you also do what you heard from your father 
they answered and said to him our father is abraham jesus said to them if you were abrahams children you would do the works of abraham
yet now you seek to kill me a man who has told you the truth that i heard from god abraham did not do this
you do the works of your father they said to him we were not born in sexual immorality we have one father god 
jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for i came from god and am here for neither have i come of myself but he sent me
why do you not understand my words it is because you cannot hear my words
you are of your father the devil and you wish to do the desires of your father he was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaks a lie he speaks from his own nature because he is a liar and the father of lies 
yet because i speak the truth you do not believe me
which one of you convicts me of sin if i speak the truth why do you not believe me
he who is of god hears the words of god you do not hear them because you are not of god 
the jews answered and said to him do we not truly say that you are a samaritan and have a demon
jesus answered i do not have a demon but i honor my father and you dishonor me 
i do not seek my glory there is one seeking and judging
truly truly i say to you if anyone keeps my word he will never see death 
the jews said to him now we know that you have a demon abraham and the prophets died but you say if anyone keeps my word he will never taste death
you are not greater than our father abraham who died are you the prophets also died who do you make yourself out to be 
jesus answered if i glorify myself my glory is nothing it is my father who glorifies meabout whom you say that he is your god
you have not known him but i know him if i would say i do not know him i would be like you a liar however i know him and keep his word
your father abraham rejoiced at seeing my day he saw it and was glad 
the jews said to him you are not yet fifty years old and you have seen abraham
jesus said to them truly truly i say to you before abraham was i am
then they picked up stones to throw at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple  
now as jesus passed by he saw a man blind from birth
his disciples asked him rabbi who sinned this man or his parents so that he was born blind 
jesus answered neither did this man sin nor his parents but so that the works of god would be revealed in him
we must do the works of him who sent me while it is day night is coming when no one will be able to work
while i am in the world i am the light of the world 
after jesus said these things he spit on the ground made mud with the saliva and smeared the mud on his eyes
he said to him go wash in the pool of siloam which is translated sent so the man went away washed and came back seeing 
then the mans neighbors and those who had seen him previously as a beggar were saying is not this the man that used to sit and beg
some said it is he others said no but he is like him but he said i am the one 
they said to him then how were your eyes opened
he answered the man who is called jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyes and said to me go to siloam and wash so i went and washed and i received my sight
they said to him where is he he replied i do not know 
they brought the man who used to be blind to the pharisees
now it was the sabbath day when jesus made the mud and opened his eyes
then again the pharisees asked him how he had received his sight he said to them he put mud on my eyes i washed and i now can see 
some of the pharisees said this man is not from god because he does not keep the sabbath others said how can a man who is a sinner do such signs so there was a division among them
so they asked the blind man again what do you say about him since he opened your eyes the blind man said he is a prophet
now the jews still did not believe about him that he was blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of him who had received his sight 
they asked the parents is this your son whom you say was born blind how then does he now see
so his parents answered them we know that this is our son and that he was born blind
how he now sees we do not know and who opened his eyes we do not know ask him he is an adult he can speak for himself 
his parents said these things because they were afraid of the jews for the jews had already agreed that if anyone would confess him to be the christ he would be thrown out of the synagogue
because of this his parents said he is an adult ask him 
so for a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him give glory to god we know that this man is a sinner
then that man replied i do not know if he is a sinner one thing i do know i was blind and now i see 
then they said to him what did he do to you how did he open your eyes
he answered i have told you already and you did not listen why do you want to hear it again you do not want to become his disciples too do you 
they insulted him and said you are his disciple but we are disciples of moses
we know that god has spoken to moses but we do not know where this one is from 
the man answered and said to them this is remarkable that you do not know where he is from and yet he opened my eyes
we know that god does not listen to sinners but if someone worships god and does his will he listens to him 
since the world began it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind
if this man were not from god he could do nothing
they answered and said to him you were completely born in sins and you are teaching us then they threw him out 
jesus heard that they had cast him out of the synagogue he found him and said do you believe in the son of man
he replied and said who is he lord that i may believe in him
jesus said to him you have seen him and it is the one who is speaking with you
the man said lord i believe and he worshiped him 
jesus said for judgment i came into this world so that those who do not see may see and so that those who see may become blind
some of the pharisees who were with him heard these things and asked him are we also blind
jesus said to them if you were blind you would have no sin but now you say we see so your sin remains  
truly truly i say to you he who does not enter through the gate into the sheep pen but climbs up some other way that man is a thief and a robber
he who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep 
the gatekeeper opens for him the sheep hear his voice and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out
when he has brought out all his own he goes ahead of them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice 
they will not follow a stranger but instead they will avoid him for they do not know the voice of strangers
jesus spoke this parable to them but they did not understand what these things were that he was saying to them 
then jesus said to them again truly truly i say to you i am the gate of the sheep
everyone who came before me is a thief and a robber but the sheep did not listen to them 
i am the gate if anyone enters in through me he will be saved he will go in and out and will find pasture
the thief does not come except to steal and kill and destroy i have come so that they will have life and have it abundantly 
i am the good shepherd the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep
the hired servant is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep he sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and escapes and the wolf snatches them and scatters them
he runs away because he is a hired servant and does not care for the sheep 
i am the good shepherd and i know my own and my own know me
the father knows me and i know the father and i lay down my life for the sheep
i have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen i must bring them also and they will hear my voice so that there will be one flock and one shepherd 
this is why the father loves me i lay down my life so that i may take it again
no one takes it away from me but i lay it down of myself i have authority to lay it down and i have authority to take it up again i have received this command from my father 
a division again occurred among the jews because of these words
many of them said he has a demon and is insane why do you listen to him
others said these are not the words of a demonpossessed man can a demon open the eyes of the blind 
then it was time for the festival of the dedication in jerusalem it was winter
and jesus was walking in the temple in the porch of solomon
then the jews surrounded him and said to him how long will you hold us doubting if you are the christ tell us openly 
jesus replied to them i told you but you do not believe the works that i do in the name of my father these testify concerning me
yet you do not believe because you are not my sheep 
my sheep hear my voice i know them and they follow me
i give them eternal life they will never die and no one will snatch them out of my hand 
my father who has given them to me is greater than all others and no one is able to snatch them out of the hand of the father
i and the father are one
then the jews took up stones again to stone him 
jesus answered them i have shown you many good works from the father for which of those works are you stoning me
the jews answered him we are not stoning you for any good work but for blasphemy because you a man are making yourself god 
jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said you are gods
if he called them gods to whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken
do you say to him whom the father set apart and sent into the world you are blaspheming because i said i am the son of god 
if i am not doing the works of my father do not believe me
but if i am doing them even if you do not believe me believe in the works so that you may know and understand that the father is in me and that i am in the father
they tried to seize him again but he went away out of their hand 
he went away again beyond the jordan to the place where john had first been baptizing and he stayed there
many people came to him and they said john indeed did no signs but all the things that john has said about this man are true
many people believed in him there  
now a certain man named lazarus was sick he was from bethany the village of mary and her sister martha
it was mary who anointed the lord with myrrh and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick 
the sisters then sent for jesus saying lord see he whom you love is sick
when jesus heard it he said this sickness is not to death but instead it is for the glory of god so that the son of god may be glorified by it 
now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus
so when he heard that lazarus was sick jesus stayed two more days in the place where he was
then after this he said to the disciples let us go to judea again 
the disciples said to him rabbi right now the jews are trying to stone you and you are going back there again
jesus answered are there not twelve hours of light in a day if someone walks in the daytime he will not stumble because he sees by the light of this world 
however if he walks at night he will stumble because the light is not in him
he said these things and after these things he said to them our friend lazarus has fallen asleep but i am going so that i may wake him out of sleep 
the disciples therefore said to him lord if he has fallen asleep he will recover
now jesus had spoken of his death but they thought that he was speaking about the sleep of resting
then jesus said to them plainly lazarus is dead 
i am glad for your sakes that i was not there so that you may believe let us go to him
thomas who was called didymus said to his fellow disciples let us also go so that we may die with jesus 
when jesus came he found that lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days
now bethany was near jerusalem about fifteen stadia away
many of the jews had come to martha and mary to comfort them about their brother
then martha when she heard that jesus was coming went to meet him but mary was sitting in the house 
martha then said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died
even now i know that whatever you ask from god he will give to you
jesus said to her your brother will rise again 
martha said to him i know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day
jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me even if he dies will live
and whoever lives and believes in me will never die do you believe this 
she said to him yes lord i believe that you are the christ the son of god who is coming into the world
when she had said this she went away and called her sister mary privately she said the teacher is here and is calling for you
when she heard this she got up quickly and went to him 
now jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the place where martha had met him
so when the jews who were with her in the house and who were comforting her saw mary getting up quickly and going out they followed her thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there
when mary came to the place where jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet and said to him lord if you had been here my brother would not have died 
when jesus saw her weeping and the jews who came with her also weeping he was deeply moved in his spirit and was troubled
he said where have you laid him they said to him lord come and see
jesus wept 
then the jews said see how much he loved lazarus
but some of them said could not this man who opened the eyes of a blind man also have made this man not die 
then jesus again being deeply moved in himself went to the tomb now it was a cave and a stone lay against it
jesus said take away the stone martha the sister of lazarus the one who had died said to jesus lord by this time the body will be decaying for he has been dead for four days
jesus said to her did i not say to you that if you believed you would see the glory of god 
so they took away the stone jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank you that you listened to me
i knew that you always listen to me but it is because of the crowd that is standing around me that i said this so that they may believe that you have sent me 
after he had said this he cried out with a loud voice lazarus come out
the dead man came out his feet and hands were bound with cloths and his face was bound about with a cloth jesus said to them untie him and let him go 
then many of the jews who came to mary and saw what jesus did believed in him
but some of them went away to the pharisees and told them the things that jesus had done 
then the chief priests and the pharisees gathered the council together and said what will we do this man does many signs
if we leave him alone like this all will believe in him the romans will come and take away both our place and our nation 
however a certain man among them caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them you know nothing
you do not consider that it is better for you that one man dies for the people than that the whole nation perishes 
now this he said not from himself instead being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for the nation
and not only for the nation but so that the children of god who are scattered would be gathered together into one
so from that day onward they planned how to put jesus to death 
no longer did jesus walk openly among the jews but he departed from there into the country near to the wilderness into a town called ephraim there he stayed with the disciples
now the passover of the jews was near and many went up to jerusalem from the country before the passover in order to purify themselves 
they were looking for jesus and speaking one with another as they stood in the temple what do you think that he will not come to the festival
now the chief priests and the pharisees had given an order that if anyone knew where jesus was he should report it so that they might seize him  
six days before the passover jesus came to bethany where lazarus was whom jesus had raised from the dead
so they made him a dinner there and martha was serving but lazarus was one of those who were lying down at the table with jesus
then mary took a litra of perfume made of very precious pure nard anointed the feet of jesus with it and wiped his feet with her hair the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume 
judas iscariot one of his disciples the one who would betray him said
why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor
now he said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief he had the moneybag and would steal from what was put in it 
jesus said allow her to keep what she has for the day of my burial
you will always have the poor with you but you will not always have me 
now a large crowd of the jews learned that jesus was there and they came not only for jesus but also to see lazarus whom jesus had raised from the dead
the chief priests conspired together so that they might also put lazarus to death
for it was because of him that many of the jews went away and believed in jesus 
on the next day a great crowd came to the festival when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem
they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and cried out hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord the king of israel 
jesus found a young donkey and sat on it as it was written
do not fear daughter of zion  see your king is coming  sitting on the colt of a donkey 
his disciples did not understand these things at first but when jesus was glorified they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him 
now the crowd testified that they had been with him when he called lazarus out of the tomb and raised him up from the dead
it was also for this reason that the crowd went out to meet him because they heard that he had done this sign
the pharisees therefore said among themselves look you can do nothing good see the world has gone after him 
now certain greeks were among those who were going up to worship at the festival
these went to philip who was from bethsaida in galilee and asked him saying sir we want to see jesus
philip went and told andrew andrew went with philip and they told jesus 
jesus answered them and said the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified
truly truly i say to you unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains by itself alone but if it dies it will bear much fruit 
he who loves his life will lose it but he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life
if anyone serves me let him follow me and where i am there will my servant also be if anyone serves me the father will honor him 
now my soul is troubled and what should i say father save me from this hour but for this reason i came to this hour
father glorify your name then a voice came from heaven and said i have glorified it and i will glorify it again
then the crowd that stood by and heard it said that it had thundered others said an angel has spoken to him 
jesus answered and said this voice did not come for me but for you
now is the judgment of this world now will the ruler of this world be thrown out 
when i am lifted up from the earth i will draw everyone to myself
he said this to indicate what kind of death he would die 
the crowd answered him we have heard from the law that the christ will stay forever how can you say the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man
jesus then said to them the light will still be with you for a short amount of time walk while you have the light so that darkness does not overtake you he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going
while you have the light believe in the light so that you may be sons of light jesus said these things and then departed and hid from them 
although jesus had done so many signs before them yet they did not believe in him
so that the word of isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled in which he said lord who has believed our report  and to whom has the arm  of the lord been revealed 
for this reason they could not believe for isaiah had also said
he has blinded their eyes  and he has hardened their heart otherwise they would see with their eyes  and understand with their hearts  and turn and i would heal them 
isaiah said these things because he saw the glory of jesus and spoke of him
but despite that many of the rulers believed in jesus but because of the pharisees they did not confess it so that they would not be banned from the synagogue
they loved the glory that comes from people more than the glory that comes from god 
jesus cried out and said the one who believes in me believes not only in me but also in him who sent me
and the one who sees me sees him who sent me 
i have come as a light into the world so that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness
if anyone hears my words but does not keep them i do not judge him for i have not come to judge the world but to save the world 
the one who rejects me and who does not receive my words has one who judges him the word i have spoken will judge him on the last day
for i did not speak for myself but it is the father who sent me who has given me the command about what to say and what to speak
i know that his command is eternal life so that is what i sayjust as the father has spoken to me so i speak  
now it was before the festival of the passover jesus knew that his hour had come to go out of this world and go to the father having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end
now the devil had already put it into the heart of judas iscariot son of simon to betray jesus so during dinner 
jesuswho knew that the father had given everything over into his hands and that he had come from god and was going back to god
got up from dinner and took off his outer clothing then he took a towel and wrapped it around himself
then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples and dry them with the towel that he had put around himself 
he came to simon peter and peter said to him lord are you going to wash my feet
jesus answered and said to him what i am doing you do not understand now but you will understand this later
peter said to him you will never wash my feet jesus answered him if i do not wash you you have no share with me
simon peter said to him lord do not only wash my feet but also my hands and my head 
jesus said to him he who is bathed has no need except to wash his feet but he is completely clean you are clean but not everyone
for jesus knew who would betray him that is why he said not all of you are clean 
so when jesus had washed their feet and taken his garments and sat down again he said to them do you understand what i have done for you
you call me teacher and lord and you are speaking correctly because so i am
if i then the lord and the teacher have washed your feet you should also wash the feet of one another
for i have given you an example so that you should also do just as i did for you 
truly truly i say to you a servant is not greater than his master nor is a messenger greater than he who sent him
if you know these things you are blessed if you do them
i am not speaking about all of you i know those whom i have chosenbut this is so that the scripture will be fulfilled he who eats my bread lifted up his heel against me 
i tell you this now before it happens so that when it happens you may believe that i am
truly truly i say to you whoever receives the one i send receives me and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me 
when jesus said this he was troubled in spirit he testified and said truly truly i say to you that one of you will betray me
the disciples looked at each other wondering of whom he was speaking 
one of his disciples whom jesus loved was lying down at the table against jesus side
simon peter motioned to this disciple and said ask him who he is speaking about
so he leaned back against the side of jesus and said to him lord who is it 
then jesus answered it is the one for whom i will dip the piece of bread and give it him so when he had dipped the bread he gave it to judas son of simon iscariot
then after the bread satan entered into him so jesus said to him what you are doing do it quickly 
now no one who was lying down at the table knew why he said this to him
some thought that since judas had the moneybag jesus said to him buy what we need to have for the festival or that he should give something to the poor
after judas received the bread he went out immediately it was night 
when judas was gone jesus said now the son of man is glorified and god is glorified in him
if god is glorified in him god will also glorify the son in himself and he will glorify him at once
little children i am with you for still a short amount of time you will seek me and as i said to the jews where i am going you cannot come now i also say this to you 
i am giving you a new commandment that you should love one another as i have loved you so also you should love one another
by this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another 
simon peter said to him lord where are you going jesus answered where i am going you cannot follow me now but you will follow later
peter said to him lord why can i not follow you now i will lay down my life for you
jesus answered will you lay down your life for me truly truly i say to you the rooster will not crow before you have denied me three times  
do not let your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me
in my fathers house are many rooms if it were not so i would have told you for i am going to prepare a place for you
if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you to myself so that where i am you will also be 
you know the way to where i am going
thomas said to jesus lord we do not know where you are going how can we know the way
jesus said to him i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
if you had known me you would have known my father also from now on you know him and have seen him 
philip said to jesus lord show us the father and that will be enough for us
jesus said to him i have been with you for such a long time and you still do not know me philip whoever has seen me has seen the father how can you say show us the father 
do you not believe that i am in the father and the father is in me the words that i say to you i do not speak from my own authority but the father living in me is doing his work
believe me that i am in the father and the father is in me or else believe because of the works themselves 
truly truly i say to you he who believes in me will do the works that i do and he will do greater works than these because i am going to the father
whatever you ask in my name i will do it so that the father will be glorified in the son
if you ask me anything in my name i will do it 
if you love me you will keep my commandments
and i will pray to the father and he will give you another comforter so that he will be with you forever
the spirit of truth the world cannot receive him because it does not see him or know him but you know him for he lives with you and will be in you 
i will not leave you as orphans i will come back to you
yet a short amount of time and the world will no longer see me but you will see me because i live you will also live
on that day you will know that i am in my father and that you are in me and that i am in you 
he who has my commandments and keeps them is the one who loves me and he who loves me will be loved by my father and i will love him and i will show myself to him
judas not iscariot said to jesus lord why is it that you will show yourself to us and not to the world 
jesus answered and said to him if anyone loves me he will keep my word my father will love him and we will come to him and we will make our home with him
he who does not love me does not keep my words the word that you hear is not from me but from the father who sent me 
i have said these things to you while i am staying with you
however the comforterthe holy spirit whom the father will send in my namehe will teach you everything and he will remind you of everything that i said to you
i leave you peace i give you my peace i do not give it as the world gives do not let your heart be troubled and do not be afraid 
you heard that i said to you i am going away and i will come back to you if you loved me you would be glad because i am going to the father for the father is greater than i am
now i have told you before it happens so that when it happens you will believe 
i will no longer speak much with you for the ruler of this world is coming he has no power over me
but in order that the world will know that i love the father i do just as the father commanded me let us get up and go from here  
i am the true vine and my father is the gardener
he takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit and he prunes every branch that bears fruit so that it will bear more fruit 
you are already clean because of the message that i have spoken to you
remain in me and i in you just as a branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine so neither can you unless you remain in me 
i am the vine you are the branches he who remains in me and i in him he bears much fruit for without me you can do nothing
if anyone does not remain in me he is thrown away like a branch and dries up and they gather the branches and throw them into the fire and they are burned up
if you remain in me and if my words remain in you ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you 
my father is glorified in this that you bear much fruit and so prove that you are my disciples
as the father has loved me i have also loved you remain in my love 
if you keep my commandments you will remain in my love as i have kept the commandments of my father and remain in his love
i have spoken these things to you so that my joy will be in you and so that your joy will be made full 
this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you
no one has greater love than thisthat one lays down his life for his friends 
you are my friends if you do the things that i command you
no longer do i call you servants for the servant does not know what his master is doing i have called you friends for everything that i heard from my father i have made known to you 
you did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you so that you would go and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain this is so that whatever you ask of the father in my name he will give it to you
these things i command you so that you love one another 
if the world hates you know that it has hated me before it hated you
if you were of the world the world would love you as its own but because you are not of the world and because i chose you out of the world therefore the world hates you 
remember the word that i said to you a servant is not greater than his master if they persecuted me they will also persecute you if they kept my word they will also keep yours
they will do all these things to you because of my name because they do not know him who sent me
if i had not come and spoken to them they would not have sin but now they have no excuse for their sin 
he who hates me also hates my father
if i had not done the works that no one else did among them they would have no sin but now they have seen and hated both me and my father
but this is in order to fulfill the word that is written in their law they hated me without a cause 
when the comforter comeswhom i will send to you from the father that is the spirit of truth who goes out from the fatherhe will testify about me
you also must testify because you have been with me from the beginning  
i have spoken these things to you so that you will not fall away
they will throw you out of the synagogues but the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think that he is offering a service to god 
they will do these things because they have not known the father nor me
i have spoken these things to you so that when their hour comes you will remember that i told you about them i did not tell you about these things in the beginning because i was with you 
but now i go to him who sent me yet none of you asks me where are you going
but because i have said these things to you sorrow has filled your heart
but truly i tell you it is better for you that i go away for if i do not go away the comforter will not come to you but if i go i will send him to you 
when he comes the comforter will prove the world to be wrong about sin about righteousness and about judgment
about sin because they do not believe in me
about righteousness because i am going to the father and you will no longer see me
and about judgment because the ruler of this world has been judged 
i have many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now
but when he the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all the truth for he will not speak from himself but he will say whatever he hears and he will tell you things that are to come
he will glorify me because he will take from what is mine and he will tell it to you 
everything that the father has is mine therefore i said that the spirit will take from what is mine and he will tell it to you
in a short amount of time you will no longer see me and after another short amount of time you will see me 
then some of his disciples said to one another what is this that he says to us a short amount of time you will no longer see me and after another short amount of time you will see me and because i go to the father
therefore they said what is this that he says a short amount of time we do not know what he is talking about 
jesus saw that they wanted to ask him and he said to them is this what you are asking each other what i meant by saying in a short amount of time and you will no longer see me and again in a short amount of time and you will see me
truly truly i say to you you will weep and lament but the world will be glad you will be sorrowful but your sorrow will be turned into joy
when a woman gives birth she has sorrow because her hour has come but when she has given birth to the child she no longer remembers her tribulation because of her joy that a man has been born into the world 
so you have sorrow now but i will see you again and your heart will be glad and no one will be able to take away your joy from you
on that day you will not ask me anything truly truly i say to you if you ask anything of the father in my name he will give it to you
until now you have not asked anything in my name ask and you will receive so that your joy will be fulfilled 
i have said these things to you in figures of speech but the hour is coming when i will no longer speak to you in figures of speech but instead i will tell you plainly about the father 
on that day you will ask in my name and i do not say to you that i will pray to the father for you
for the father himself loves you because you have loved me and because you have believed that i came from god
i came from the father and i have come into the world again i am leaving the world and i am going to the father 
his disciples said see now you are speaking plainly and you are not using figures of speech
now we know that you know all things and you do not need anyone to ask you questions because of this we believe that you have come from god
jesus answered them do you believe now 
see the hour is coming yes and has indeed come when you will be scattered everyone to his own home and you will leave me alone yet i am not alone because the father is with me
i have spoken these things to you so that you will have peace in me in the world you have tribulation but have courage i have conquered the world  
after jesus said these things he lifted up his eyes to the heavens and said father the hour has come glorify your son so that the son will glorify you
just as you gave him authority over all flesh so that he would give eternal life to everyone whom you have given him 
this is eternal life that they know you the only true god and him whom you sent jesus christ
i glorified you on the earth i have finished the work that you have given me to do
now father glorify me along with yourself with the glory that i had with you before the world was made 
i revealed your name to the people whom you gave me from the world they were yours and you gave them to me and they have kept your word
now they know that everything that you have given me comes from you
for i have given them all the words that you gave me they received them and truly knew that i came from you and they believed that you sent me 
i pray for them i do not pray for the world but for those whom you have given me for they are yours
everything that is mine is yours and yours is mine and i am glorified in them
i am no longer in the world but these people are in the world and i am coming to you holy father keep them in your name that you have given me so that they will be one just as we are one 
while i was with them i kept them safe in your name which you have given me i guarded them and not one of them was destroyed except for the son of destruction so that the scriptures would be fulfilled
now i am coming to you but i am saying these things in the world so that they will have my joy fulfilled in themselves
i have given them your word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world just as i am not of the world 
i do not ask for you to take them away from the world but for you to keep them safe from the evil one
they are not of the world just as i am not of the world
set them apart by the truth your word is truth 
just as you sent me into the world so i have sent them into the world
for their sakes i have set myself apart so that they themselves may also be set apart in truth 
i pray not only for these but also for those who will believe in me through their word
so that they will all be one just as you father are in me and i am in you may they also be in us so that the world will believe that you have sent me 
the glory that you gave me i have given to them so that they will be one just as we are one
i in them and you in methat they may be brought to complete unity so that the world will know that you sent me and that you have loved them just as you loved me 
father i want those you have given me to be with me where i am and to see my glory the glory you gave me because you loved me before the foundation of the world 
righteous father the world did not know you but i know you and these know that you sent me
i made your name known to them and i will make it known so that the love with which you have loved me will be in them and i will be in them  
after jesus spoke these words he went out with his disciples to the other side of the kidron brook where there was a garden into which he and his disciples entered
now judas who was going to betray him also knew the place for jesus often met there with his disciples
then judas leading a company of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and pharisees went there with lanterns torches and weapons 
then jesus having known all the things that would happen to him went forward and asked them who are you looking for
they answered him jesus of nazareth jesus said to them i am judas who betrayed him was also standing with the soldiers 
so when he said to them i am they went backward and fell to the ground
then again he asked them who are you looking for again they said jesus of nazareth 
jesus answered i told you that i am so if you are looking for me let these go
this was in order to fulfill the word that he said of those whom you have given me i lost no one 
then simon peter who had a sword drew it and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear now the name of the servant was malchus
jesus said to peter put the sword back into its sheath should i not drink the cup that the father has given me 
so a company of soldiers and the captain and the officers of the jews seized jesus and tied him up
they led him first to annas for he was fatherinlaw of caiaphas who was high priest that year
now caiaphas was the one who had given the advice to the jews that it would be better that one man die for the people 
simon peter followed jesus and so did another disciple now that disciple was known to the high priest and he entered with jesus into the courtyard of the high priest
but peter was standing at the door outside so the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and he brought peter in 
then the female servant the doorkeeper said to peter are you not also one of the disciples of this man he said i am not
now the servants and the officers were standing there and they had made a charcoal fire for it was cold and they were warming themselves peter was also with them standing there and warming himself 
the high priest then asked jesus about his disciples and his teaching
jesus answered him i have spoken openly to the world i was always teaching in synagogues and in the temple where all the jews come together i said nothing in secret
why did you ask me ask those who have heard me about what i said look these people know what i said 
when jesus had said this one of the officers standing there struck jesus and said is that how you answer the high priest
jesus answered him if i spoke wrongly testify about the wrong but if rightly why do you hit me
then annas sent him tied up to caiaphas the high priest 
now simon peter was standing and warming himself the people then said to him are you not also one of his disciples he denied it and said i am not
one of the servants of the high priest who was a relative of the man whose ear peter had cut off said did i not see you in the garden with him
then peter denied it again and immediately the rooster crowed 
then they led jesus from caiaphas to the government headquarters it was early in the morning and they did not enter the government headquarters so that they would not be defiled but would be able to eat the passover
so pilate went out to them and said what accusation are you bringing against this man
they answered and said to him if this man was not an evildoer we would not have given him over to you 
pilate therefore said to them take him yourselves and judge him according to your law the jews said to him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death
they said this so that the word of jesus would be fulfilled which he had spoken to indicate by what kind of death he would die 
then pilate entered the government headquarters again and called jesus and he said to him are you the king of the jews
jesus answered do you speak from yourself or did others speak to you about me
pilate answered i am not a jew am i your own people and the chief priests gave you over to me what did you do 
jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were part of this world then my servants would fight so that i would not be given over to the jews but now my kingdom is not from here
pilate then said to him are you a king then jesus answered you say that i am a king for this purpose i have been born and for this purpose i have come into the world to testify to the truth everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice 
pilate said to him what is truth when he had said this he went out again to the jews and said to them i find no guilt in this man
but you have the custom that i release one person to you at the passover so do you want me to release the king of the jews to you
then they cried out again and said not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a revolutionary  
then pilate took jesus and whipped him
the soldiers wove a crown of thorns they put it on the head of jesus and dressed him with a purple garment
they came to him and said hail king of the jews and they struck him 
then pilate went outside again and said to them see i am bringing him outside to you so that you will know that i find no guilt in him
so jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment pilate said to them look here is the man
when therefore the chief priests and the officers saw jesus they cried out and said crucify him crucify him pilate said to them take him yourselves and crucify him for i find no guilt in him 
the jews answered him we have a law and according to that law he has to die because he claimed to be the son of god
when pilate heard this statement he was even more afraid
and he entered the government headquarters again and said to jesus where do you come from but jesus gave him no answer 
then pilate said to him are you not speaking to me do you not know that i have authority to release you and authority to crucify you
jesus answered him you do not have any authority over me except for what has been given to you from above therefore he who gave me over to you has a greater sin 
at this answer pilate tried to release him but the jews cried out saying if you release this man you are not a friend of caesar everyone who makes himself a king speaks against caesar
when pilate heard these words he brought jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place called the pavement but in the aramaic language gabbatha 
now it was the day of preparation for the passover at about the sixth hour pilate said to the jews see here is your king
they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate said to them should i crucify your king the chief priests answered we have no king but caesar
then pilate gave jesus over to them to be crucified 
then they took jesus and he went out carrying the cross for himself to the place called the place of a skull which in the aramaic language is called golgotha
they crucified jesus there and with him two other men one on each side with jesus in the middle 
pilate also wrote a sign and put it on the cross there it was written jesus of nazareth the king of the jews
many of the jews read this sign because the place where jesus was crucified was near the city the sign was written in aramaic in latin and in greek 
then the chief priests of the jews said to pilate do not write the king of the jews but rather this one said i am king of the jews
pilate answered what i have written i have written 
when the soldiers crucified jesus they took his clothes divided them into four shares one for each of them and also the tunic now the tunic was seamless woven in one piece from the top
then they said to each other let us not tear it but instead let us cast lots for it to decide whose it will be this happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled which said they divided my garments among themselves  and cast lots for my clothing this is what the soldiers did 
now standing beside jesus cross were his mother his mothers sister mary the wife of clopas and mary magdalene
when jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby he said to his mother woman see your son
then he said to the disciple see your mother from that hour the disciple took her to his own home 
after this knowing that everything was now accomplished and so that the scriptures would be fulfilled jesus said i am thirsty
a container full of sour wine was placed there so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop staff and lifted it up to his mouth
when jesus had taken the sour wine he said it is finished he bowed his head and gave up his spirit 
then the jews because it was the day of preparation and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the sabbath for that sabbath was especially important asked pilate to break their legs and to remove them
then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the second man who had been crucified with jesus
when they came to jesus they saw that he was already dead so they did not break his legs 
however one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and immediately blood and water came out
the one who saw this has testified and his testimony is true he knows that what he said is true so that you may also believe 
for these things happened in order to fulfill scripture not one of his bones will be broken
again another scripture says they will look at him whom they pierced 
after these things joseph of arimathea since he was a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews asked pilate if he could take away the body of jesus pilate gave him permission so joseph came and took away his body
nicodemus also camehe who at first had come to jesus by night he brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about one hundred litras 
so they took the body of jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices as was the custom of the jews to bury bodies
now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden was a new tomb in which no person had yet been buried
because it was the day of preparation for the jews and because the tomb was close by they laid jesus in it  
now early on the first day of the week while it was still dark mary magdalene came to the tomb and she saw the stone rolled away from the tomb
so she ran and came to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and she said to them they took away the lord out from the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him 
then peter and the other disciple went out and they were going to the tomb
they both ran together and the other disciple quickly ran ahead of peter and arrived at the tomb first
then stooping down he saw the linen cloths lying there but he did not go inside 
simon peter then arrived after him and went into the tomb he saw the linen cloths lying there
and the cloth that had been on his head it was not lying with the linen cloths but was folded up in a place by itself 
then the other disciple the one who first arrived at the tomb also went in and he saw and believed
for until that time they still did not know the scripture that he should rise from the dead
so the disciples went back home again 
but mary was standing outside the tomb weeping as she wept she stooped down into the tomb
she saw two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the foot of where the body of jesus had lain
they said to her woman why are you weeping she said to them because they took away my lord and i do not know where they have put him 
when she said this she turned around and saw jesus standing there but she did not know that it was jesus
jesus said to her woman why are you weeping whom are you looking for she thought that he was the gardener so she said to him sir if you have taken him away tell me where you have put him and i will take him away 
jesus said to her mary she turned and said to him in aramaic rabboni which is to say teacher
jesus said to her do not touch me for i have not yet gone up to the father but go to my brothers and say to them that i will go up to my father and your father and my god and your god
mary magdalene came and told the disciples i have seen the lord and that he had said these things to her 
on the evening of that day the first day of the week the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the jews jesus came and stood in the middle of them and said to them peace to you
after he said this he showed them his hands and his side the disciples rejoiced when they saw the lord 
jesus then said to them again peace to you as the father has sent me so i am sending you
when jesus had said this he breathed on them and said to them receive the holy spirit
whoevers sins you forgive they are forgiven whoevers sins you keep back they are kept back 
thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came
the other disciples later said to him we have seen the lord he said to them unless i see in his hands the mark of the nails and put my finger into the mark of the nails and put my hand into his side i will not believe 
after eight days his disciples were inside again and thomas was with them jesus came while the doors were closed and stood among them and said peace to you
then he said to thomas reach here with your finger and see my hands reach here with your hand and put it into my side do not be unbelieving but believe 
thomas answered and said to him my lord and my god
jesus said to him because you have seen me you have believed blessed are those who have not seen and believed 
now jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples signs that have not been written in this book
but these have been written so that you would believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and so that believing you would have life in his name  
after these things jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias this is how he revealed himself
simon peter was together with thomas called didymus nathaniel from cana in galilee the sons of zebedee and two other disciples of jesus
simon peter said to them i am going fishing they said to him we too will come with you they went and got into a boat but they caught nothing during the whole night 
now when it was already early in the morning jesus stood on the beach but the disciples did not know it was jesus
so jesus said to them young men do you have anything to eat they answered him no
he said to them throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some so they threw their net and were not able to draw it in because of the large number of fish 
then the disciple whom jesus loved said to peter it is the lord when simon peter heard that it was the lord he tied up his outer garment for he was undressed and threw himself into the sea
the other disciples came in the boat for they were not far from the land about two hundred cubits off and they were pulling the net full of fish
when they got out upon the land they saw a charcoal fire there and fish laid on it with bread 
jesus said to them bring some of the fish that you have just caught
simon peter then went up and drew the net to land full of large fish  of them but even with so many the net was not torn 
jesus said to them come and eat breakfast none of the disciples dared ask him who are you they knew it was the lord
jesus came took the bread and gave it to them and the fish also
this was the third time that jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead 
after they ate breakfast jesus said to simon peter simon son of john do you love me more than these peter said to him yes lord you know that i love you jesus said to him feed my lambs
he said to him again a second time simon son of john do you love me peter said to him yes lord you know that i love you jesus said to him shepherd my sheep 
he said to him a third time simon son of john do you love me peter was sorrowful because jesus had said to him a third time do you love me he said to him lord you know all things you know that i love you jesus said to him feed my sheep
truly truly i say to you when you were young you used to gird yourself and walk wherever you wanted but when you become old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will gird you and carry you where you will not want to go 
now jesus said this in order to indicate with what kind of death peter would glorify god after he had said this he said to peter follow me 
peter turned around and saw the disciple whom jesus loved following them the one who had also leaned back against the side of jesus at the dinner and who had said lord who is the one who will betray you
peter saw him and then said to jesus lord what will this man do 
jesus said to him if i want him to stay until i come what is that to you follow me
so this statement spread among the brothers that that disciple would not die yet jesus did not say to peter that the other disciple would not die but if i want him to stay until i come what is that to you 
this is the disciple who testifies about these things and who wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true
there are also many other things that jesus did. if each one were written down, i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.
the former account i wrote theophilus told all that jesus began to do and to teach
until the day that he was taken up after he had given commands through the holy spirit to the apostles he had chosen
after his suffering he presented himself alive to them with many convincing proofs for forty days he appeared to them and he spoke about the kingdom of god 
when he was meeting together with them he commanded them not to leave jerusalem but to wait for the promise of the father about which he said you heard from me
that john indeed baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit in a few days 
when they were assembled together they asked him lord is this the time you will restore the kingdom to israel
he said to them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has determined by his own authority
but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses both in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth 
when the lord jesus had said these things as they were looking up he was raised up and a cloud hid him from their eyes
while they were looking intensely to heaven as he went suddenly two men stood by them in white clothing
they said you men of galilee why do you stand here looking into heaven this jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will return in the same manner as you saw him going into heaven 
then they returned to jerusalem from the mountain that is called olives which is near to jerusalem a sabbath days journey
when they arrived they went up into the upper chamber where they were staying they were peter john james andrew philip thomas bartholomew matthew james son of alphaeus simon the zealot and judas son of james
they all were devoted with one purpose to prayer together with the women and mary the mother of jesus and his brothers 
in those days peter stood up in the midst of the brothers about  names and said
brothers it was necessary that the scripture should be fulfilled that the holy spirit spoke before by the mouth of david concerning judas who guided the ones who arrested jesus 
for he was one of us and received a share of this ministry
now this man bought a field with the earnings he received for his wickedness and there he fell headfirst and his body burst open and all his intestines poured out
all those living in jerusalem heard about this so they called that field in their language akeldama that is field of blood 
for it is written in the book of psalms let his field be made desolate  and do not let even one person live there let someone else take his position of leadership 
it is necessary therefore that one of the men who accompanied us all the time the lord jesus went in and out among us
beginning from the baptism of john to the day that he was taken up from us become a witness with us of his resurrection
they put forward two men joseph called barsabbas who was also called justus and matthias 
they prayed and said you lord know the hearts of all people so reveal which of these two is the one whom you have chosen
to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which judas turned away to go to his own place
they cast lots for them and the lot fell to matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles  
when the day of pentecost came they were all together in the same place
suddenly a sound like the rush of a violent wind came from heaven and it filled the whole house where they were sitting
there appeared to them tongues like fire that were distributed and they sat upon each one of them
they were all filled with the holy spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit gave them the ability 
now there were jews who were living in jerusalem godly men from every nation under heaven
when this sound was heard the multitude came together and was confused because everyone heard them speaking in his own language
they were amazed and marveled they said really are not all these who are speaking galileans 
why is it that we are hearing them each in our own language in which we were born
parthians and medes and elamites and those who live in mesopotamia in judea and cappadocia in pontus and asia
phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and the parts of libya toward cyrene and visitors from rome
jews and proselytes cretans and arabianswe hear them telling in our languages about the mighty works of god 
they were all amazed and perplexed they said to one another what does this mean
but others mocked and said they are full of new wine 
but peter stood with the eleven raised his voice and declared to them men of judea and all of you who live at jerusalem let this be known to you pay attention to my words
for these people are not drunk as you assume for it is only the third hour of the day 
but this is what was spoken through the prophet joel
it will be in the last days god says  i will pour out my spirit on all flesh your sons and your daughters will prophesy  your young men will see visions  and your old men will dream dreams 
surely on my servants  and my female servants in those days i will pour out my spirit and they will prophesy 
i will show wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth below  blood fire and vapor of smoke 
the sun will be turned to darkness  and the moon to blood  before the great and remarkable  day of the lord comes
it will be that everyone who calls  on the name of the lord will be saved 
men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth was a man accredited to you by god with the mighty deeds and wonders and signs which god did through him in your midst as you yourselves know
this man was handed over by gods predetermined plan and foreknowledge and you by the hand of lawless men put him to death by nailing him to a cross
but god raised him up freeing him from the agonies of death because it was impossible for him to be held by it 
for david says about him i saw the lord always before my face  for he is beside my right hand  so that i should not be moved
therefore my heart was glad  and my tongue rejoiced also my flesh will live in hope  
for you will not abandon my soul to hades neither will you allow  your holy one to see decay
you have made known to me the ways of life  you will make me full of gladness with your face 
brothers it is proper for me to speak to you confidently about the patriarch david that he both died and was buried and his tomb is with us to this day
therefore he was a prophet and knew that god had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of the fruit of his loins on his throne
he saw what was to happen in the future and spoke about the resurrection of the christ that he was neither abandoned to hades nor did his flesh see decay 
this jesusgod raised him up of which we all are witnesses
therefore having been exalted to the right hand of god and having received the promised holy spirit from the father he has poured out what you see and hear 
for david did not ascend to the heaven but he says the lord said to my lord  sit at my right hand
until i make your enemies  the footstool for your feet
therefore let all the house of israel certainly know that god has made him both lord and christ this jesus whom you crucified 
now when they heard this they were pierced in their hearts and said to peter and the rest of the apostles brothers what must we do
then peter said to them repent and be baptized each of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
for the promise is to you and to your children and to all who are far off as many people as the lord our god will call 
with many other words he testified and exhorted them saying be saved from this perverse generation
then they received his word and were baptized and there were added in that day about three thousand souls
they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and fellowship in the breaking of bread and in prayers 
fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles
all who believed were together and had all things in common
and they sold their property and possessions and distributed them to all according to the needs anyone had 
so day after day they devoted themselves with one purpose in the temple they also broke bread in homes and they shared food together with glad and generous hearts
praising god and having favor with all the people and every day the lord added to their number those who were being saved  
now peter and john were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer the ninth hour
now a man who was lame from his mothers womb was being carried to the temple gate called beautiful they would place him there every day so he could ask those who were going into the temple for alms
when he saw peter and john about to enter the temple he asked them for alms 
peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look at us
the lame man looked at them expecting to receive something from them
but peter said silver and gold i do not have but what i do have i will give to you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth walk 
taking him by the right hand peter raised him up and immediately the mans feet and ankles were made strong
leaping up the lame man stood and began to walk and he entered with peter and john into the temple walking leaping and praising god 
all the people saw him walking and praising god
they noticed that it was the man who had been asking people for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement because of what had happened to him 
as he was holding on to peter and john all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called solomons greatly marveling
when peter saw this he answered the people you israelite men why do you marvel why do you fix your eyes on us as if we made him walk by our own power or godliness 
the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers has glorified his servant jesus he is the one whom you handed over and rejected before the face of pilate when he had decided to release him
you rejected the holy and righteous one and you asked instead for a murderer to be given to you 
you killed the founder of life whom god raised from the deadand we are witnesses of this
on the basis of faith in his name his name made this man whom you see and know strong the faith that is through jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all 
now brothers i know that you acted in ignorance as did also your rulers
but the things which god foretold by the mouth of all the prophets that his christ should suffer he has now fulfilled 
repent therefore and turn so that your sins may be blotted out
so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the lord and that he may send the christ who has been appointed for you jesus 
he is the one heaven must receive until the time of the restoration of all things about which god spoke from ancient times by the mouth of his holy prophets
moses indeed said the lord god will raise up a prophet like me from among your brothers you must listen to everything he tells you
it will happen that every person who does not listen to that prophet will be completely destroyed from among the people 
yes and all the prophets from samuel and those who came after him they spoke out and announced these days
you are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that god made with your ancestors as he said to abraham in your seed all the families of the earth will be blessed
after god raised up his servant he sent him to you first in order to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness  
as peter and john were speaking to the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them
they were deeply troubled because peter and john were teaching the people and proclaiming in jesus the resurrection from the dead
they laid hands on them and put them in custody until the next morning since it was now evening
but many of the people who had heard the message believed and the number of the men who believed was about five thousand 
it came about on the next day that their rulers elders and scribes gathered together in jerusalem
annas the high priest was there and caiaphas and john and alexander and all who were relatives of the high priest
when they had set peter and john in their midst they asked them by what power or in what name have you done this 
then peter filled with the holy spirit said to them you rulers of the people and elders
if we are on trial today concerning a good deed done to a sick man and by what means this man was healed
let it be known to you all and to all the people of israel that this man stands before you healthy in the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom you crucified but whom god raised from the dead 
jesus christ is the stone which you builders rejected but which has been made the cornerstone
there is no salvation in any other person for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved 
now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and realized that they were ordinary uneducated men they were surprised becoming aware that peter and john had been with jesus
because they saw the man who was healed standing with them they had nothing to say against this 
but after they had commanded the apostles to leave the council meeting they talked among themselves
they said what should we do with these men for a remarkable sign has been done through them and this is evident to everyone who lives in jerusalem and we cannot deny it
but in order that it spreads no further among the people let us warn them not to speak anymore to anyone in this name
then they called them in and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of jesus 
but peter and john answered and said to them whether it is proper in the sight of god to obey you rather than him you judge
we are not able to stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard 
after further warning peter and john they let them go they were unable to find any excuse to punish them because all of the people were glorifying god for what had been done
the man who had experienced this sign of healing was more than forty years old 
after they were set free peter and john came to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them
when they heard it they raised their voices with one purpose to god and said lord you made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all that is in them
you spoke by the holy spirit through the mouth of your servant our father david why did the gentile nations rage  and the peoples imagine useless things 
you said  the kings of the earth set themselves together and the rulers gathered together  against the lord and against his christ 
indeed both herod and pontius pilate together with the gentiles and the people of israel gathered together in this city against your holy servant jesus whom you anointed
they gathered together to do all that your hand and your plan had decided in advance would happen 
now lord look upon their warnings and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness
stretch out your hand to heal and to give signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant jesus
after they had prayed the place where they were gathered together was shaken and they were all filled with the holy spirit and they spoke the word of god with boldness 
the great number of those who believed were of one heart and soul no one said that anything he possessed was his own but they had everything in common
with great power the apostles were proclaiming their testimony about the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all 
there was no person among them who lacked anything for all who owned title to lands or houses sold them and brought the money from the things that were sold
and laid it at the apostles feet and it was distributed to each one according to their need 
joseph whom the apostles called barnabas which is translated son of encouragement a levite a man from cyprus
sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet  
now a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a piece of property
and he kept back part of the sale money his wife also knew it and brought the other part of it and laid it at the apostles feet 
but peter said ananias why has satan filled your heart to lie to the holy spirit and to keep back part of the price of the land
while it remained unsold did it not remain your own and after it was sold was it not under your authority why did you put it in your heart to do this you have not lied to men but to god
hearing these words ananias fell down and breathed his last and great fear came upon all who heard it
the young men arose and wrapped him up and they carried him out and buried him 
after about three hours his wife came in not knowing what had happened
peter said to her tell me whether you sold the land for so much she said yes for so much 
then peter said to her how is it that you have agreed together to test the spirit of the lord look the feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out
she immediately fell down at his feet and breathed her last when the young men came in they found her dead and carried her out and buried her beside her husband
great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard these things 
many signs and wonders were taking place among the people through the hands of the apostles they were all together in solomons porch
but none of the rest had the courage to join them however they were held in high esteem by the people 
still more believers were being added to the lord multitudes of men and women
so that they even carried the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches so that as peter came by his shadow might fall on some of them
there also came together a great number of people from the towns around jerusalem bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits and they were all healed 
but the high priest rose up and all those who were with him which is the sect of the sadducees and they were filled with jealousy
and laid hands on the apostles and held them in custody in the common prison 
yet during the night an angel of the lord opened the doors of the prison and led them out and said
go stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life
when they heard this they entered into the temple about daybreak and taught but the high priest came and those who were with him and called the council together all the elders of the people of israel and sent to the prison to have the apostles brought 
but the officers that went did not find them in the prison and they returned and reported
we found the prison securely shut and the guards standing at the door but when we had opened it we found no one inside 
now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words they were much perplexed concerning them as to what would come of it
then someone came and told them the men whom you put in the prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people 
so the captain went with the officers and brought them back but without violence for they feared the people that they might be stoned
when they had brought them they set them before the council the high priest interrogated them
saying we ordered you with a command not to teach in this name and yet you have filled jerusalem with your teaching and desire to bring this mans blood upon us 
but peter and the apostles answered we must obey god rather than men
the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom you killed by hanging him on a tree
god exalted him to his right hand to be a prince and a savior to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins
we are witnesses of these things and so is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him 
when the council members heard this they were furious and they wanted to kill the apostles
but a pharisee named gamaliel a teacher of the law who was honored by all the people stood up in the council and gave a command to take the men outside for a little while 
then he said to them men of israel pay close attention to what you propose to do with these people
for before these days theudas rose up claiming to be somebody and a number of men about four hundred joined him he was killed and all who had been obeying him were scattered and came to nothing
after this man judas of galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him he also perished and all who had been obeying him were scattered 
now i say to you keep away from these men and let them alone for if this plan or work is of men it will be overthrown
but if it is of god you will not be able to overthrow them you may even find that you are fighting against god so they were persuaded 
then they called the apostles in and beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of jesus and let them go
they went away from before the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name
thereafter every day in the temple and from house to house they were continuously teaching and proclaiming the good news that the christ is jesus  
now in these days when the number of the disciples was multiplying a complaint by the grecian jews began against the hebrews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of help 
the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them and said it is not right for us to give up the word of god in order to serve tables
you should therefore choose brothers seven men from among yourselves men of good reputation full of the spirit and of wisdom whom we may appoint over this business
as for us we will always continue in prayer and in the ministry of the word 
their speech pleased the whole multitude so they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the holy spirit and philip prochorus nicanor timon parmenas and nicolaus a proselyte from antioch
the believers brought these men before the apostles who prayed and then placed their hands upon them 
so the word of god continued to spread and the number of disciples in jerusalem increased greatly and a large number of the priests became obedient to the faith 
now stephen full of grace and power was doing great wonders and signs among the people
but there arose some people who belonged to the synagogue called the synagogue of the freedmen of the cyrenians and alexandrians and some from cilicia and asia these people were debating with stephen 
but they were not able to stand against the wisdom and the spirit with which stephen spoke
then they bribed some men to say we have heard stephen speak blasphemous words against moses and against god 
they stirred up the people the elders and the scribes and they approached stephen and seized him and brought him before the council
they brought false witnesses who said this man does not stop speaking words against this holy place and the law
for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that moses handed down to us
everyone who sat in the council fixed their eyes on him and saw his face was like the face of an angel  
the high priest said are these things true
stephen said brothers and fathers listen to me the god of glory appeared to our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he lived in haran
he said to him leave your land and your relatives and go into the land that i will show you 
then he left the land of the chaldeans and lived in haran from there after his father died god brought him into this land where you live now
he gave none of it as an inheritance to him no not even enough to set a foot on but he promisedeven though abraham had no child yetthat he would give the land as a possession to him and to his descendants after him 
god was speaking to him like this that his descendants would live for a while in a foreign land and that the inhabitants there would bring them into slavery and mistreat them for four hundred years
but i will judge the nation that they serve said god and after that they will come out and worship me in this place
then god gave abraham the covenant of circumcision so abraham became the father of isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day isaac became the father of jacob and jacob the father of the twelve patriarchs 
because the patriarchs were jealous of joseph they sold him into egypt but god was with him
and rescued him from all his tribulation he gave joseph favor and wisdom in the presence of pharaoh king of egypt who appointed him governor over egypt and over all his household 
now a famine and great tribulation came over all egypt and canaan and our fathers could find no food
but when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt he sent out our fathers on their first trip
on their second trip joseph made himself known to his brothers and josephs family became known to pharaoh 
joseph sent his brothers back to invite jacob his father to come to egypt along with all his relatives seventyfive persons in all
so jacob went down into egypt and he died he and our fathers
they were carried over to shechem and laid in the tomb that abraham had bought for a price in silver from the sons of hamor in shechem 
as the time of the promise approached the promise that god had made to abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt
until there arose another king over egypt a king who did not know about joseph
he deceived our people and mistreated our fathers forcing them to expose their newborn infants so they would not be kept alive 
at that time moses was born he was very beautiful before god and was nourished for three months in his fathers house
when he was placed outside pharaohs daughter adopted him and raised him as her own son 
moses was educated in all the wisdom of the egyptians and he was mighty in his words and works
but when he was about forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brothers the descendants of israel
seeing an israelite being mistreated moses defended him and avenged him who was oppressed by striking the egyptian
he thought that his brothers would understand that god by his hand was giving them salvation but they did not understand 
on the next day he appeared to them when they were fighting and he tried to make peace between them saying men you are brothers why are you wronging one another
but the one who had wronged his neighbor pushed him away and said who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us
would you like to kill me as you killed the egyptian yesterday 
moses ran away after hearing this statement he became a foreigner in the land of midian where he became the father of two sons
when forty years were past an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai in a flame of fire in a bush 
when moses saw the fire he marveled at the sight and as he approached to look at it the voice of the lord came saying
i am the god of your fathers the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob moses trembled and did not dare to look 
the lord said to him take off the sandals from your feet for the place where you are standing is holy ground
i have certainly seen the oppression of my people who are in egypt i have heard their groaning and i have come down to rescue them now come i will send you to egypt 
this moses whom they rejected when they said who appointed you a ruler and a judgehe was the one whom god sent as both a ruler and deliverer god sent him by the hand of the angel who appeared to moses in the bush
moses led them out of egypt after doing miracles and signs in egypt and at the sea of reeds and in the wilderness during forty years
it is the same moses who said to the people of israel god will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers a prophet like me 
this is the man who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who had spoken to him on mount sinai who was with our fathers and who received living words to give to us
but our fathers refused to obey him they pushed him away from themselves and in their hearts they turned back to egypt
at that time they said to aaron make us gods who will lead us as for this moses who led us out of the land of egypt we do not know what has happened to him 
so they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol and rejoiced because of the work of their hands
but god turned and gave them up to worship the stars in the sky as it is written in the book of the prophets did you bring me offerings and sacrifices  during the forty years in the wilderness house of israel 
you accepted the tabernacle of molech  and the star of the god rephan and the images that you made to worship them  and i will carry you away beyond babylon 
our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness just as god commanded when he spoke to moses that he should make it like the pattern that he had seen
later our fathers under joshua received the tabernacle and brought it with them when they took possession of the land god took the land from the nations and drove them out before the face of our fathers the tabernacle remained in the land until the time of david
who found favor in the sight of god and he asked if he might find a dwelling place for the house of jacob  the phrase the house of jacob is found in many ancient copies other ancient texts have the phrase the god of jacob   
but it was solomon who built the house for god
however the most high does not live in houses made with hands as the prophet says
heaven is my throne  and the earth is the footstool for my feet what kind of house can you build for me says the lord  or what is the place for my rest
did my hand not make all these things 
you stiffnecked people uncircumcised in heart and ears you always resist the holy spirit you act just as your fathers acted
which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute they killed the prophets who appeared in advance of the coming of the righteous one and you have now become the betrayers and murderers of him also
you people who received the law that angels had ordained but you did not keep it 
now when the council members heard these things they were furious in their hearts and they ground their teeth at stephen
but he being full of the holy spirit looked up intently into heaven and saw the glory of god and he saw jesus standing at the right hand of god
stephen said look i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at the right hand of god 
at this the council members covered their ears and shouting out with a loud voice they rushed at him with one purpose
they forced him out of the city and began to stone him the witnesses laid down their outer clothing at the feet of a young man named saul 
as they were stoning stephen he was calling out to the lord and saying lord jesus receive my spirit
he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice lord do not hold this sin against them when he had said this he fell asleep  
saul was in agreement with his death so there began on that day a great persecution against the church that was in jerusalem and the believers were all scattered throughout the regions of judea and samaria except the apostles
devout men buried stephen and made great lamentation over him
but saul tried to destroy the church he would enter house after house drag off both men and women and put them in prison 
yet the believers who had been scattered went about preaching the word
philip went down to the city of samaria and proclaimed to them the christ 
crowds of people were giving close attention to what was being said by philip with one mind they heard him and they saw the signs he did
unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed crying out with a loud voice and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed
so there was much joy in that city 
but there was a certain man in the city named simon who had earlier been practicing sorcery he used to astonish the people of samaria while claiming that he was an important person
all the samaritans from the least to the greatest paid attention to him they said this man is that power of god which is called great
they listened to him because he had astonished them for a long time with his sorceries 
but when they believed philip as he proclaimed the gospel about the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women
even simon himself believed and after he was baptized he stayed with philip constantly when he saw signs and mighty works taking place he was amazed 
now when the apostles in jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent to them peter and john
when they had come down they prayed for them that they might receive the holy spirit
for until that time the holy spirit had not come upon any of them they had only been baptized into the name of the lord jesus
then peter and john placed their hands on them and they received the holy spirit 
now when simon saw that the holy spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles hands he offered them money
he said give me this authority too that whoever i place my hands on might receive the holy spirit 
but peter said to him may your silver perish along with you because you thought to obtain the gift of god with money
you have no part or allotted portion in this matter because your heart is not right with god
therefore repent of this wickedness of yours and pray to the lord so that he might perhaps forgive you for the intention of your heart
for i see that you are in the poison of bitterness and in the bonds of unrighteousness 
simon answered and said pray to the lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me 
when they had testified and spoken the word of the lord peter and john returned to jerusalem proclaiming the gospel to many villages of the samaritans 
now an angel of the lord spoke to philip and said arise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from jerusalem to gaza this road is in a desert
he arose and went behold there was a man from ethiopia a eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians he was in charge of all her treasure he had come to jerusalem to worship
he was returning and sitting in his chariot and was reading the prophet isaiah 
the spirit said to philip go over and stay close to this chariot
so philip ran to him and heard him reading isaiah the prophet and said do you understand what you are reading
then he said how can i unless someone guides me he invited philip to come up into the chariot and sit with him 
now the passage of the scripture which the ethiopian was reading was this he was led like a sheep to the slaughter  and like a lamb before his shearer is silent  so he did not open his mouth
in his humiliation  justice was taken away from him who can give a full account of his descendants  for his life was taken from the earth 
so the eunuch asked philip and said i beg you tell me who is the prophet speaking about himself or someone else
philip began to speak and beginning with this scripture he proclaimed the gospel about jesus to him 
as they went on the road they came to some water and the eunuch said look there is water here what prevents me from being baptized
 the best ancient copies do not have acts  philip said if you believe with all your heart you may be baptized the ethiopian answered i believe that jesus christ is the son of god 
so the ethiopian commanded the chariot to stop they went down into the water both philip and the eunuch and philip baptized him 
when they came up out of the water the spirit of the lord took philip away and the eunuch saw him no more but went on his way rejoicing
but philip appeared at azotus and he went through that region proclaiming the gospel to all the cities until he came to caesarea  
but saul still speaking threats even of murder against the disciples of the lord went to the high priest
and asked him for letters for the synagogues in damascus so that if he found any who belonged to the way whether men or women he might bring them bound to jerusalem 
as he was traveling it happened that as he came near to damascus suddenly there shone all around him a light out of heaven
and he fell upon the ground and heard a voice saying to him saul saul why are you persecuting me 
saul replied who are you lord the lord said i am jesus whom you are persecuting
but rise enter into the city and it will be told you what you must do
the men who traveled with saul stood speechless hearing the voice but seeing no one 
saul arose from the ground and when he opened his eyes he could see nothing so they led him by the hand and brought him into damascus
for three days he was without sight and he neither ate nor drank 
now there was a disciple at damascus named ananias the lord said to him in a vision ananias he said see i am here lord
the lord said to him arise and go to the street which is called straight and at the house of judas ask for a man from tarsus named saul for he is praying
he has seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and laying his hands on him so that he might see again 
but ananias answered lord i have heard from many about this man how much harm he has done to your holy people in jerusalem
he has authority from the chief priests to put in bonds everyone here who calls upon your name
but the lord said to him go for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel
for i will show him how much he must suffer for the cause of my name 
so ananias departed and entered into the house laying his hands on him he said brother saul the lord jesus who appeared to you on the road when you were coming has sent me so that you might receive your sight and be filled with the holy spirit
immediately something like scales fell from sauls eyes and he received his sight he arose and was baptized
and he ate and was strengthened he stayed with the disciples in damascus for several days 
right away he proclaimed jesus in the synagogues saying that he is the son of god
all who heard him were amazed and said is not this the man who destroyed those in jerusalem who called on this name he has come here to take them bound to the chief priests
but saul became more and more powerful and he was causing distress among the jews who lived in damascus by proving that jesus is the christ 
after many days the jews planned together to kill him
but their plan became known to saul they watched the gates day and night in order to kill him
but his disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall lowering him in a basket 
when he had come to jerusalem saul attempted to join the disciples but they were all afraid of him not believing that he was a disciple
but barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and he told them how saul had seen the lord on the road and that the lord had spoken to him and how at damascus saul had spoken boldly in the name of jesus 
he was with them going in and out around jerusalem he spoke boldly in the name of the lord jesus
and debated with the grecian jews but they kept trying to kill him
when the brothers learned of this they brought him down to caesarea and sent him away to tarsus 
so then the church throughout all judea galilee and samaria had peace and was built up and walking in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy spirit the church grew in numbers
now it came about that as peter went throughout the whole region he came down also to gods holy people who lived in the town of lydda 
there he found a certain man named aeneas who had been in his bed for eight years for he was paralyzed
peter said to him aeneas jesus christ heals you get up and make your bed and right away he got up
so everyone who lived in lydda and in sharon saw the man and they turned to the lord 
now there was in joppa a certain disciple named tabitha which is translated dorcas this woman was full of good works and merciful deeds that she did for the poor
it came about in those days that she fell sick and died when they had washed her they laid her in an upper room 
since lydda was near joppa and the disciples had heard that peter was there they sent two men to him pleading with him come to us without delay
peter arose and went with them when he had arrived they brought him to the upper room and all the widows stood by him weeping showing him the tunics and garments that dorcas had made while she had been with them 
peter put them all out of the room knelt down and prayed then turning to the body he said tabitha arise then she opened her eyes and seeing peter she sat up
peter then gave her his hand and raised her up and when he called gods holy people and the widows he presented her alive to them
this matter became known throughout all joppa and many people believed on the lord
it happened that peter stayed for many days in joppa with a man named simon a tanner  
now there was a certain man in the city of caesarea cornelius by name a centurion of what was called the italian company of soldiers
he was a devout man one who feared god with all his household gave many alms to the people and prayed to god constantly 
about the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of god coming to him the angel said to him cornelius
cornelius stared at the angel and was very afraid and said what is it sir the angel said to him your prayers and your alms have gone up as a memorial offering into gods presence
now send men to the city of joppa to bring a man named simon who is called peter
he is staying with a tanner named simon whose house is by the seaside 
when the angel who spoke to him had left cornelius called two of his house servants and a devout soldier from among those who served him
cornelius told them all that had happened and sent them to joppa 
now on the next day at about the sixth hour as they were on their journey and were approaching the city peter went up upon the housetop to pray
he then became hungry and wanted something to eat but while the people were cooking some food a trance came on him
and he saw the sky open and a certain container descending something like a large sheet coming down to the earth let down by its four corners
in it were all kinds of fourfooted animals and things that crawled on the earth and birds of the sky 
then a voice spoke to him rise peter kill and eat
but peter said not so lord for i have never eaten anything that was defiled and unclean
but the voice came to him again a second time what god has made clean you must not call defiled
this happened three times then the container was immediately taken back up into the sky 
now while peter was very confused about what the vision that he had seen could mean behold the men who were sent by cornelius stood before the gate after they had asked their way to the house
they called out and asked whether simon who was also called peter was staying there 
while peter was still thinking about the vision the spirit said to him behold three men are looking for you  some ancient copies have two men are looking for you or some men are looking for you 
arise and go down and go with them do not hesitate to go with them because i have sent them
so peter went down to the men and said i am he whom you are seeking why have you come 
they said a centurion named cornelius a righteous man and one who fears god and is well spoken of by all the nation of the jews was instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house so he could listen to a message from you
so peter invited them to come in and stay with him on the next morning he got up and went with them and some of the brothers from joppa accompanied him 
on the following day they came to caesarea cornelius was waiting for them he had called together his relatives and his close friends 
it came about that when peter entered cornelius met him and fell down at his feet to worship him
but peter helped him up saying stand up i too am a man 
while peter was talking with him he went in and found many people gathered together
he said to them you yourselves know that it is not lawful for a jewish man to associate with or to visit a foreigner but god has shown me that i should not call any man defiled or unclean
that is why i came without arguing when i was sent for so i ask you why you sent for me 
cornelius said four days ago at this very hour i was praying at the ninth hour in my house and see a man stood before me in bright clothing
he said cornelius your prayer has been heard by god and your alms have reminded god about you
so send someone to joppa and call to you a man named simon who is called peter he is staying in the house of a tanner named simon by the seaside  some ancient copies add when he comes he will speak to you 
so at once i sent for you you are kind to have come now then we are all here present in the sight of god to hear everything that you have been instructed by the lord to say  instead of instructed by the lord to say some ancient copies have instructed by god to say  
then peter opened his mouth and said truly i understand that god is not partial
instead in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him 
you know the message that he sent to the people of israel when he announced the good news about peace through jesus christ who is lord of all
you yourselves know the events that took place which occurred throughout all judea beginning in galilee after the baptism that john announced
the events concerning jesus of nazareth how god anointed him with the holy spirit and with power he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil for god was with him 
we are witnesses of all the things jesus did both in the country of the jews and in jerusalem they killed him by hanging him on a tree
but god raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen
not by all the people but to the witnesses who were chosen beforehand by godby us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead 
he commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that this is the one who has been chosen by god to be the judge of the living and the dead
about him all the prophets testify that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name 
while peter was still saying these things the holy spirit fell on all of those who were listening to his message
the people who belonged to the circumcision group of believersall of those who came with peterwere amazed because the gift of the holy spirit was poured out also on the gentiles 
for they heard these gentiles speaking in tongues and exalting god then peter answered
can anyone keep water from these people so they should not be baptized these people who have received the holy spirit as well as we
then he commanded them to be baptized in the name of jesus christ then they asked him to stay with them for several days  
now the apostles and the brothers who were in judea heard that the gentiles also had received the word of god
when peter had come up to jerusalem they who belonged to the circumcision group criticized him
they said you associated with uncircumcised men and ate with them 
but peter started to explain the matter to them in detail saying
i was praying in the city of joppa and in a trance i saw a vision of a container coming down like a large sheet let down from heaven by its four corners it descended to me
i gazed at it and i thought about it i saw the fourlegged animals of earth wild beasts things that crawled and birds of the sky 
then i heard a voice say to me get up peter kill and eat
i said not so lord for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth
but the voice answered again from heaven what god has made clean you must not call defiled
this happened three times and then everything was taken back up into heaven again 
behold right away there were three men standing in front of the house where we were they had been sent from caesarea to me
the spirit commanded me to go with them and that i should make no distinction regarding them these six brothers went with me and we went into the mans house
he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying send men to joppa and bring back simon who is called peter
he will speak to you a message by which you will be savedyou and all your household 
as i began to speak to them the holy spirit came on them just as on us in the beginning
i remembered the words of the lord how he said john indeed baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit 
then if god gave to them the same gift as he gave to us when we believed on the lord jesus christ who was i that i could oppose god
when they heard these things they said nothing in response but they glorified god and said then god has given repentance for life to the gentiles also 
now those who had been scattered by the persecution that arose over stephen spread as far as phoenicia cyprus and antioch speaking the word only to jews
but some of them men from cyprus and cyrene came to antioch and spoke also to greeks proclaiming to them the gospel about the lord jesus
the hand of the lord was with them a great number believed and turned to the lord 
news about them came to the ears of the church in jerusalem and they sent out barnabas as far as antioch
when he came and saw the grace of god he was glad and he encouraged them all to remain with the lord with purpose of heart
for he was a good man and full of the holy spirit and of faith and many people were added to the lord 
barnabas then went out to tarsus to search carefully for saul
when he found him he brought him to antioch it came about that for an entire year they gathered together with the church and taught many people the disciples were first called christians in antioch 
now in these days some prophets came down from jerusalem to antioch
one of them agabus by name stood up and indicated by the spirit that a great famine would occur over all the world this happened in the days of claudius 
so the disciples as each one was able determined to send a contribution for the relief of the brothers in judea
they did this they sent money to the elders by the hand of barnabas and saul  
now about that time herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church so that he might mistreat them
he killed james the brother of john with the sword 
after he saw that this pleased the jews he proceeded to arrest peter also that was during the days of unleavened bread
after arresting him he put him in prison assigning him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him he was intending to bring him to the people after the passover 
so peter was kept in the prison but prayer was made earnestly to god for him by those in the church
on the night before herod was going to bring him out for trial peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains while guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison 
behold an angel of the lord suddenly appeared by him and a light shone in the prison cell he struck peter on the side and woke him and said get up quickly and his chains fell off his hands
the angel said to him gird yourself and put on your sandals peter did so the angel said to him put on your outer garment and follow me 
so peter followed the angel and went out he did not know that what was done by the angel was real he thought he was seeing a vision
after they had passed by the first guard and the second they came to the iron gate that led into the city it opened for them by itself they went out and went down a street and the angel left him right away 
when peter came to himself he said now i truly know that the lord has sent his angel and delivered me out of the hand of herod and from everything the jewish people were expecting
when he realized this he went to the house of mary the mother of john also called mark where many people had gathered and were praying 
when he knocked at the door of the gate a servant girl named rhoda came to answer
when she recognized peters voice out of joy she failed to open the gate instead she came running into the room she reported that peter was standing at the gate
so they said to her you are insane but she insisted that it was so they said it is his angel 
but peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door they saw him and were amazed
peter motioned to them with his hand to be silent and he told them how the lord had brought him out of prison he said report these things to james and the brothers then he left and went to another place 
now when it became day there was no small disturbance among the soldiers over what had happened to peter
after herod had searched for him and could not find him he questioned the guards and ordered them to be put to death then herod went down from judea to caesarea and stayed there 
now herod was very angry with the people of tyre and sidon they went to him with one purpose and after persuading blastus the kings assistant to help them they asked for peace because their country received its food from the kings country
on a set day herod dressed himself in royal clothing and sat on a throne he made a speech to them 
the people shouted this is the voice of a god not of a man
immediately an angel of the lord struck him because he did not give god the glory he was eaten by worms and died 
but the word of god increased and multiplied
so when barnabas and saul had completed their mission they returned from jerusalem  some ancient copies read they returned to jerusalem  bringing with them john also called mark  
now in the church in antioch there were some prophets and teachers they were barnabas simeon who is called niger lucius of cyrene manaen the foster brother of herod the tetrarch and saul
while they were worshiping the lord and fasting the holy spirit said set apart for me barnabas and saul to do the work to which i have called them
after they had fasted prayed and laid their hands on these men they sent them off 
so barnabas and saul having been sent out by the holy spirit went down to seleucia from there they sailed away to cyprus
while they were in the city of salamis they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogues of the jews they also had john for an assistant 
when they had gone through the whole island to paphos they found a certain magician a jewish false prophet whose name was barjesus
this magician associated with the proconsul sergius paulus who was an intelligent man this man summoned barnabas and saul because he sought to hear the word of god
but elymas the magician that is how his name is translated opposed them he tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith 
but saul who is also called paul filled with the holy spirit stared at him intensely
and said you son of the devil you are full of all kinds of deceit and wickedness you are an enemy of every kind of righteousness you will never stop twisting the straight paths of the lord will you 
now look the hand of the lord is upon you and you will become blind you will not see the sun for a while immediately there fell on elymas a mist and darkness he started going around seeking people to lead him by the hand
after the proconsul saw what had happened he believed because he was astonished at the teaching about the lord 
now paul and his friends set sail from paphos and came to perga in pamphylia but john left them and returned to jerusalem
paul and his friends traveled from perga and came to antioch of pisidia there they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down
after the reading of the law and the prophets the leaders of the synagogue sent them a message saying brothers if you have any message of encouragement for the people here say it 
so paul stood up and motioned with his hand he said men of israel and you who fear god listen
the god of this people israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they stayed in the land of egypt and with an uplifted arm he led them out of it
for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness  some ancient copies read for about forty years he cared for them in the wilderness  
after he had destroyed seven nations in the land of canaan he gave our people their land for an inheritance
all these events took place over  years after all these things god gave them judges until samuel the prophet 
then the people asked for a king and god gave them saul son of kish a man from the tribe of benjamin to be king for forty years
after god removed him from the kingship he raised up david to be their king it was about david that god testified saying i have found david son of jesse to be a man after my heart who does all i want him to do 
from this mans descendants god has brought to israel a savior jesus as he promised to do
before the arrival of jesus john proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of israel
as john was finishing his work he said who do you think i am i am not the one but listen one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet i am not worthy to untie 
brothers children of the offspring of abraham and those among you who fear god it is to us that the message about this salvation has been sent
for they who live in jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize him and they fulfilled the voices of the prophets that are read every sabbath by condemning him 
even though they found no reason for the death penalty they called on pilate to kill him
when they had completed all the things that were written about him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb 
but god raised him from the dead
he was seen for many days by those who had come up with him from galilee to jerusalem these people are now his witnesses to the people 
so we tell you the good news the promise that came to our fathers
god has fulfilled for us their children by raising up jesus as it is written in the second psalm you are my son  today i have become your father
as to his raising him from the dead never to return to decay he has spoken in this way i will give you the holy and sure blessings  promised to david 
this is why he also says in another psalm you will not allow your holy one  to see decay
for when david had served the purpose of god in his own generation he fell asleep he was laid with his fathers and his body experienced decay
but he whom god raised up experienced no decay 
so let it be known to you brothers that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you the law of moses could not make you righteous
but by this man god makes righteous everyone who believes 
so then be careful that the thing the prophets spoke about does not happen to you
look you despisers  and be astonished and then perish for i am doing a work in your days  a work that you would never believe  even if someone announces it to you 
as paul and barnabas left the people begged them that they might speak these same words again the next sabbath
when the synagogue meeting ended many of the jews and devout proselytes followed paul and barnabas who were speaking to them and persuading them to continue in the grace of god 
on the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of the lord
when the jews saw the crowds they were filled with envy and spoke against the things that were said by paul and insulted him 
but paul and barnabas spoke out boldly and said it was necessary that the word of god should first be spoken to you seeing you push it away from yourselves and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life see we will turn to the gentiles
for so has the lord commanded us saying i have appointed you as a light for the gentiles  that you should bring salvation  to the uttermost parts of the earth 
as the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord as many as were appointed to eternal life believed
the word of the lord was spread out through the whole region 
but the jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city they stirred up persecution against paul and barnabas and threw them out of their region
but paul and barnabas shook off the dust from their feet against them then they went to the city of iconium
and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy spirit  
it came about in iconium that paul and barnabas entered together into the synagogue of the jews and spoke in such a way that a great multitude both of jews and of greeks believed
but the jews who were disobedient stirred up the minds of the gentiles and made them bitter against the brothers 
so they stayed there for a long time speaking boldly with the lords power while he gave evidence about the message of his grace he did this by granting signs and wonders to be done by the hands of paul and barnabas
but the people of the city were divided some sided with the jews others with the apostles 
both gentiles and jews together with their leaders made an attempt to mistreat them and to stone them
but as soon as they learned about this they fled to the lycaonian cities of lystra and derbe and the surrounding region
where they continued to proclaim the gospel 
at lystra a certain man sat powerless in his feet a cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked
this man heard paul speaking paul fixed his eyes on him and saw that he had faith to be made well
so he said to him in a loud voice stand up on your feet then the man jumped up and walked around 
when the multitude saw what paul had done they raised their voice saying in the dialect of lycaonia the gods have become like men and come down to us
they called barnabas zeus and paul hermes because he was the main speaker
the priest of zeus whose temple was just outside the city brought oxen and wreaths to the gates he and the multitudes wanted to offer sacrifice 
but when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of it they tore their clothing and quickly went out into the crowd crying out
men why are you doing these things we also are human beings with the same nature as you we are telling you good news that you should turn from these useless things to the living god who made the heavens the earth the sea and everything that is in them
in the past ages he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways 
but still he did not leave himself without witness in that he did good and gave you the rains from heaven and fruitful seasons filling your hearts with food and gladness
even with these words paul and barnabas barely kept the multitudes from sacrificing to them 
but some jews from antioch and iconium came and persuaded the crowds they stoned paul and dragged him out of the city thinking that he was dead
yet as the disciples were standing around him he got up and entered the city the next day he went to derbe with barnabas 
after they had proclaimed the gospel in that city and made many disciples they returned to lystra to iconium and to antioch
they kept strengthening the souls of the disciples and encouraging them to continue in the faith saying we must enter into the kingdom of god through many tribulations 
when they had appointed for them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they entrusted them to the lord in whom they had believed
then they passed through pisidia and came to pamphylia
when they had spoken the word in perga they went down to attalia
from there they sailed to antioch where they had been committed to the grace of god for the work which they had now completed 
when they arrived in antioch and gathered the church together they reported all the things that god had done with them and how he had opened a door of faith for the gentiles
they stayed for a long time with the disciples  
some men came down from judea to antioch and taught the brothers saying unless you are circumcised according to the custom of moses you cannot be saved
this brought paul and barnabas into a sharp dispute and debate with them so paul and barnabas along with some others from among them were appointed to go up to jerusalem to meet with the apostles and elders about this question 
they therefore being sent by the church passed through both phoenicia and samaria and announced the conversion of the gentiles they brought great joy to all the brothers
when they came to jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders and they reported all the things that god had done with them 
but certain men who believed who belonged to the group of pharisees stood up and said it is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of moses
so the apostles and the elders gathered together to consider this matter 
after much debate peter stood up and said to them brothers you know that a good while ago god made a choice among you that by my mouth the gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe
god who knows the heart has testified to them by giving them the holy spirit just as he did to us
he made no distinction between us and them having cleansed their hearts by faith 
now therefore why do you test god that you should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear
but we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the lord jesus just as they were 
all the multitude kept silent while they listened to barnabas and paul report the signs and wonders god had worked among the gentiles through them 
after they stopped speaking james answered saying brothers listen to me
simon has told how god first graciously helped the gentiles in order to take from them a people for his name 
the words of the prophets agree with this as it is written
after these things i will return  and i will build again the tabernacle of david  which has fallen down i will set up and restore its ruins again 
so that the remnant of men may seek the lord  including all the gentiles called by my name
this is what the lord says  who has done these things  that have been known from ancient times  there are some copies of the ancient greek text that have a slightly different meaning this is what the lord says to whom are known all his deeds from ancient times  
therefore i have decided that we should not trouble those of the gentiles who turn to god
but we will write to them that they must keep away from the pollution of idols from sexual immorality and from the meat of strangled animals and from blood
for moses has been proclaimed in every city from ancient generations and he is preached in the synagogues every sabbath 
then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church to choose judas called barsabbas and silas who were leaders of the brothers and send them to antioch with paul and barnabas
they wrote this with their hands from the apostles and elders your brothers to the gentile brothers in antioch syria and cilicia greetings 
because we have heard that certain men have gone out from us with no orders from us and have disturbed you with words that upset your souls
it seemed good to us who have come to one mind to choose men and to send them to you with our beloved barnabas and paul
men who have risked their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ 
therefore we have sent judas and silas who will report to you the same things in their own words
for it seemed good to the holy spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things
that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols blood things strangled and from sexual immorality if you avoid these things you will do well farewell 
so they when they were dismissed came down to antioch after they gathered the multitude together they delivered the letter
when they had read it they rejoiced because of the encouragement
judas and silas also prophets encouraged the brothers with many words and strengthened them 
after they had spent some time there they were sent away in peace from the brothers to those who had sent them
 the best ancient copies do not have verse  see acts  but it seemed good to silas to remain there 
but paul and barnabas stayed in antioch teaching and preaching along with many others the word of the lord 
after some days paul said to barnabas let us return now and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the lord and see how they are
barnabas wanted to also take with them john who was called mark
but paul thought it was not good to take mark who had left them in pamphylia and did not go further with them in the work 
then there arose a sharp disagreement so that they separated from each other and barnabas took mark with him and sailed away to cyprus
but paul chose silas and left after he was entrusted by the brothers to the grace of the lord
then he went through syria and cilicia strengthening the churches  
paul also came to derbe and to lystra and behold a certain disciple named timothy was there the son of a jewish woman who was a believer but his father was a greek
he was well spoken of by the brothers who were at lystra and iconium
paul wanted him to travel with him so he took him and circumcised him because of the jews that were in those places for they all knew that his father was a greek 
as they were going along through the cities they were passing along the decrees to obey that were decided on by the apostles and elders who were in jerusalem
so the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in number daily 
paul and his companions went through the regions of phrygia and galatia since they had been forbidden by the holy spirit to proclaim the word in the province of asia
when they came near mysia they attempted to go into bithynia but the spirit of jesus prevented them
so passing by mysia they came down to the city of troas 
a vision appeared to paul in the night a man of macedonia was standing there begging him and saying come over into macedonia and help us
when paul had seen the vision immediately we sought to go to macedonia concluding that god had called us to preach the gospel to them 
setting sail therefore from troas we made a straight course to samothrace and the next day we came to neapolis
from there we went to philippi which is a city of macedonia the most important city in the district and a roman colony and we stayed in this city for several days
on the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river where we thought there would be a place of prayer we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together 
a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple from the city of thyatira who worshiped god listened to us the lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by paul
when she and her house were baptized she pleaded with us saying if you have judged me to be faithful to the lord come and stay in my house and she persuaded us 
it came about that as we were going to the place of prayer a certain slave girl who had a spirit of divination encountered us she brought her masters much gain by fortunetelling
this woman followed after paul and us and shouted saying these men are servants of the most high god they proclaim to you the way of salvation
she did this for many days but paul being greatly annoyed by her turned and said to the spirit i command you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and it came out at that same hour 
when her masters saw that their hope of profit was now gone they seized paul and silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities
when they had brought them to the magistrates they said these men are causing trouble in our city they are jews
they proclaim customs that are not lawful for romans to accept or practice 
then the crowd rose up together against paul and silas the magistrates tore their garments off them and commanded them to be beaten with rods
when they had laid many blows upon them they threw them into prison and commanded the jailer to guard them securely
after he got this command the jailer threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks 
around midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god and the other prisoners were listening to them
suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyones chains were unfastened 
the jailer was awakened from sleep and saw the open prison doors he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought that the prisoners had escaped
but paul shouted with a loud voice saying do not harm yourself because we are all here 
the jailer called for lights and rushed in and trembling for fear fell down before paul and silas
and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved
they said believe in the lord jesus and you will be saved you and your household 
they spoke the word of the lord to him together with everyone in his house
then the jailer took them at the same hour of the night and washed their wounds and he and those in his entire house were baptized immediately
then as he brought paul and silas up into his house and he set food before them he rejoiced greatly with those of his house that he had believed in god 
now when it was day the magistrates sent word to the guards saying let those men go
the jailer reported the words to paul saying the magistrates have sent word to me to let you go now therefore come out and go in peace 
but paul said to them they have publicly beaten us without a trial even though we are roman citizensand they threw us into prison do they now want to send us away secretly no let them come themselves and lead us out
the guards reported these words to the magistrates and when they heard that paul and silas were romans they were afraid
the magistrates came and apologized to them and brought them out asking them to go away from the city 
so paul and silas went out of the prison and came to the house of lydia when paul and silas saw the brothers they encouraged them and then departed from the city  
now when they had passed through the cities of amphipolis and apollonia they came to the city of thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the jews
paul as his custom was went to them and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures 
he was opening the scriptures and explaining that it was necessary for the christ to suffer and to rise again from the dead he said this jesus whom i proclaim to you is the christ
some of the jews were persuaded and joined paul and silas including a large number of devout greeks and not a few of the leading women 
but the unbelieving jews being moved with jealousy took certain wicked men from the marketplace gathered a crowd together and set the city in an uproar assaulting the house of jason they were seeking to bring paul and silas out to the people
but when they did not find them they dragged jason and certain other brothers before the officials of the city crying these men who have turned the world upside down have come here also
these men whom jason has welcomed act against the decrees of caesar they say that there is another kingjesus 
they troubled the crowd and the officials of the city who heard these things
but after they took security from jason and the rest they let them go 
that night the brothers sent paul and silas to berea when they arrived there they went into the synagogue of the jews
now these people were more noble than those in thessalonica for they received the word with all readiness of mind examining the scriptures daily to see whether these things were so
therefore many of them believed including some influential greek women and many men 
but when the jews of thessalonica learned that paul was also proclaiming the word of god at berea they went there and stirred up and troubled the crowds
then immediately the brothers sent paul to go to the sea but silas and timothy stayed there
those who were leading paul took him as far as the city of athens as they left paul there they received from him instructions for silas and timothy to come to him as quickly as possible 
now while paul was waiting for them in athens his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols
so he reasoned every day in the synagogue with the jews and others who worshiped god as well as in the marketplace with those who happened to be there 
but also some of the epicurean and stoic philosophers encountered him some said what is this babbler trying to say others said he seems to be one who calls people to follow strange gods because he was proclaiming the gospel about jesus and the resurrection 
they took paul and brought him to the areopagus saying may we know this new teaching which you were speaking
for you bring some strange things to our ears therefore we want to know what these things mean
now all the athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing but either telling or listening about something new 
so paul stood in the middle of the areopagus and said you men of athens i see that you are very religious in every way
for as i passed along and observed the objects of your worship i found an altar with this inscription to an unknown god what therefore you worship in ignorance this i announce to you 
the god who made the world and everything in it since he is lord of heaven and earth does not live in temples built with hands
neither is he served by mens hands as though he needed anything since he himself gives people life and breath and everything else 
from one man he made every nation of people to live on the surface of the earth having determined their appointed seasons and the boundaries of their living areas
so that they should search for god and perhaps they may feel their way toward him and find him yet he is not far from each one of us 
for in him we live and move and have our being just as one of your own poets has said for we also are his offspring
therefore since we are gods offspring we ought not to think that the qualities of deity are like gold or silver or stoneimages created by the art and imagination of man 
therefore god overlooked the times of ignorance but now he commands all men everywhere to repent
this is because he has set a day when he will judge the world in righteousness by the man he has appointed god has given proof of this man to everyone by raising him from the dead 
now when the men of athens heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked paul but others said we will listen to you again about this matter
after that paul left them
but certain men joined him and believed including dionysius the areopagite a woman named damaris and others with them  
after these things paul left athens and went to corinth
there he met a jew named aquila a native of pontus who had recently come from italy with his wife priscilla because claudius had commanded all the jews to leave rome paul went to them
and because he worked at the same trade he stayed with them and labored for they were tentmakers by trade 
so paul reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath trying to persuade both jews and greeks
now when silas and timothy came down from macedonia paul devoted himself to the word testifying to the jews that jesus was the christ
but when the jews opposed and insulted him paul shook out his garment at them and said to them may your blood be upon your own heads i am clean from now on i will go to the gentiles 
then he left from there and went to the house of a man named titius justus a man who worshiped god his house was next to the synagogue
crispus the leader of the synagogue believed in the lord together with all his household and many of the corinthians who heard about it believed and were baptized 
the lord said to paul in the night in a vision do not be afraid but speak and do not be silent
for i am with you and no one will try to harm you for i have many people in this city
paul lived there for a year and six months teaching the word of god among them 
but when gallio became governor of achaia the jews rose up with one mind against paul and brought him before the judgment seat
they said this man persuades people to worship god contrary to the law 
yet when paul was about to speak gallio said to the jews you jews if indeed it were a matter of wrong or a wicked crime it would be reasonable to put up with you
but since these are questions about words and names and your own law settle it yourselves i do not wish to be a judge of these matters 
gallio made them leave the judgment seat
so they all seized sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue and beat him in front of the judgment seat but gallio did not care what they did 
paul after staying there for many more days left the brothers and sailed for syria with priscilla and aquila before he left the seaport cenchreae he had his hair cut off because of a vow he had taken
when they came to ephesus paul left priscilla and aquila there but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews 
when they asked paul to stay a longer time he declined
but taking his leave of them he said i will return again to you if it is gods will he then set sail from ephesus 
when paul had landed at caesarea he went up and greeted the jerusalem church and then went down to antioch
after having spent some time there paul departed and went through the regions of galatia and phrygia strengthening all the disciples 
now a certain jew named apollos an alexandrian by birth came to ephesus he was eloquent in speech and mighty in the scriptures
apollos had been instructed in the teachings of the lord being fervent in spirit he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning jesus but he knew only the baptism of john
apollos began to speak boldly in the synagogue but when priscilla and aquila heard him they took him aside and explained to him the way of god more accurately 
when he desired to pass over into achaia the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples in achaia to welcome him when he arrived he greatly helped those who believed by grace
apollos powerfully refuted the jews in public debate showing by the scriptures that jesus is the christ  
it came about that while apollos was at corinth paul passed through the upper country and came to the city of ephesus and found certain disciples there
paul said to them did you receive the holy spirit when you believed they said to him no we did not even hear about the holy spirit 
paul said into what then were you baptized they said into johns baptism
so paul replied john baptized with the baptism of repentance he told the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him that is in jesus 
when the people heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
then when paul had laid his hands on them the holy spirit came on them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied
in all they were about twelve men 
paul went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of god
but when some jews were hardened and disobedient they began to speak evil of the way before the crowd so paul left them and took the disciples with him reasoning with them every day in the lecture hall of tyrannus
this continued for two years so that all who lived in asia heard the word of the lord both jews and greeks 
god was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of paul
so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick and their illnesses left them and the evil spirits came out of them 
but there were jewish exorcists traveling through the area they called on the name of the lord jesus so they could have power over evil spirits when they said by the jesus whom paul proclaims i command you to come out
the jewish high priest whose name was sceva had seven sons who were doing this 
an evil spirit answered them jesus i know and paul i know but who are you
the evil spirit in the man leaped on the exorcists and subdued them and beat them up then they fled out of that house naked and wounded
this became known to all both jews and greeks who lived at ephesus they became very afraid and the name of the lord jesus was honored 
also many of the believers came and confessed and gave a full account of the evil things they had done
many who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in the sight of everyone when they counted the value of them it was fifty thousand pieces of silver
so the word of the lord spread very widely in powerful ways 
now after these things were completed paul decided in the spirit to pass through macedonia and achaia on his way to jerusalem he said after i have been there i must also see rome
paul sent to macedonia two of those who served him timothy and erastus but he himself stayed in asia for a while 
at about that time there was no small disturbance in ephesus concerning the way
a certain silversmith named demetrius who made silver shrines of artemis brought in much business for the craftsmen
so he gathered together the workmen of that occupation and said men you know that in this business we make much money 
you see and hear that not only at ephesus but almost throughout all asia this paul has persuaded and turned away many people he is saying that gods made by hands are not gods
not only is there danger that our trade will be discredited but also that the temple of the great goddess artemis might be regarded as worthless and her greatness would be brought to nothing she whom all asia and the world worship 
when they heard this they were filled with anger and cried out saying great is artemis of the ephesians
the whole city was filled with confusion and the people rushed with one mind into the theater they had seized pauls travel companions gaius and aristarchus who came from macedonia 
paul wanted to enter in among the crowd of people but the disciples prevented him
also some of the officials of the province of asia who were his friends sent him a message pleading with him not to enter the theater
some people were shouting one thing and some another for the crowd was in confusion most of them did not even know why they had come together 
some of the crowd advised alexander whom the jews were pushing forward so alexander motioned with his hand wanting to give a defense to the assembly
but when they recognized that he was a jew they all cried out for about two hours with one voice saying great is artemis of the ephesians 
when the town clerk had quieted the crowd he said you men of ephesus what man is there who does not know that the city of the ephesians is temple keeper of the great artemis and of the image which fell down from heaven
seeing then that these things are undeniable you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash
for you have brought these men to this court who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess 
therefore if demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have an accusation against anyone the courts are open and there are proconsuls let them accuse one another
but if you are seeking anything more it should be resolved in the regular assembly
for we are in danger of being accused of rioting today and there is no cause we can give to justify this uproar when he had said this he dismissed the assembly  some greek copies number this last sentence as verse   
after the uproar was over paul sent for the disciples and after he encouraged them he said farewell and left to go into macedonia
when he had gone through those regions and had spoken many words of encouragement to them he came to greece
after he had spent three months there a plot was formed against him by the jews as he was about to sail for syria so he decided to return through macedonia 
accompanying him as far as asia were sopater son of pyrrhus from berea aristarchus and secundus both from the thessalonian believers gaius of derbe timothy and tychicus and trophimus from asia
but these men had gone before us and were waiting for us at troas
we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and in five days we came to them in troas there we stayed for seven days 
on the first day of the week when we were gathered together to break bread paul spoke to the believers he was planning to leave the next day so he prolonged his message until midnight
there were many lamps in the upper room where we had come together 
in the window was sitting a young man named eutychus who fell into a deep sleep as paul spoke even longer this young man still sleeping fell down from the third story and was picked up dead
but paul went down stretched himself out on him and embraced him then he said do not be upset any more for he is alive 
then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate after talking with them much longer until dawn he left
they brought back the boy alive and were greatly comforted 
we ourselves went ahead of paul by ship and sailed away to assos where we planned to take paul on board this is what he himself desired to do because he planned to go by land
when he met us at assos we took him onto the ship and went to mitylene 
then we sailed from there and arrived the next day opposite the island of chios the following day we touched at the island of samos and the day after we came to the city of miletus
for paul had decided to sail past ephesus so that he would not spend any time in asia for he was hurrying to be in jerusalem for the day of pentecost if it were at all possible for him to do so 
from miletus he sent men to ephesus and called to himself the elders of the church
when they had come to him he said to them you yourselves know from the first day that i set foot in asia how i always spent my time with you
i kept serving the lord with all lowliness of mind and with tears and in trials that happened to me because of the plots of the jews
you know how i did not keep back from declaring to you anything that was useful and how i taught you in public and from house to house
testifying to both jews and greeks about repentance toward god and of faith in our lord jesus 
now look i am going to jerusalem compelled by the spirit not knowing what will happen to me there
except that the holy spirit testifies to me in every city that chains and afflictions await me
but i do not consider my life valuable to myself if only i may finish the race and complete the ministry that i received from the lord jesus to testify to the gospel of the grace of god 
now look i know that you all among whom i went about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face no more
therefore i testify to you this day that i am innocent of the blood of any man
for i did not hold back from declaring to you the whole will of god 
therefore be careful about yourselves and about all the flock of which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers be careful to shepherd the church of god which he purchased with his own blood  instead of with his own blood  some ancient copies read with the blood of his own son 
i know that after my departure vicious wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock
even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth to draw away the disciples after them 
so be on guard remember that for three years i never stopped warning each one of you night and day with tears
now i commit you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are being sanctified 
i coveted no mans silver gold or clothing
you yourselves know that these hands served my own needs and the needs of those who were with me
in all things i gave you an example of how you should help the weak by laboring and of how you should remember the words of the lord jesus words that he himself said it is more blessed to give than to receive 
after he had spoken in this way he knelt down and prayed with them all
there was a lot of crying and they embraced paul and kissed him
they were in anguish most of all because of what he had said that they would never see his face again then they escorted him to the ship  
when we had gone away from them and set sail we took a straight course to the city of cos and the next day to the city of rhodes and from there to the city of patara
when we found a ship crossing over to phoenicia we went aboard and set sail 
after sighting cyprus leaving it on the left side of the boat we sailed on to syria and landed at tyre where the ship was to unload its cargo
after we found the disciples we stayed there seven days through the spirit they kept urging paul not to go to jerusalem 
when our days there were over we left and went on our way and they all with their wives and children accompanied us out of the city then we knelt down on the beach prayed
and said farewell to each other then we went on board the ship and they returned home 
when we had finished the voyage from tyre we arrived at ptolemais there we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day
on the next day we left and went to caesarea we entered the house of philip the evangelist who was one of the seven and we stayed with him
now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied 
as we stayed there for some days a certain prophet named agabus came down from judea
he came to us and took pauls belt with it he tied his own feet and hands and said thus says the holy spirit this is how the jews in jerusalem will tie up the man who owns this belt and they will hand him over into the hands of the gentiles 
when we heard these things both we and the people who lived in that place pleaded with paul not to go up to jerusalem
then paul answered what are you doing weeping and breaking my heart for i am ready not only to be tied up but also to die in jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
since paul would not be persuaded we remained silent and then we said may the will of the lord be done 
after these days we picked up our bags and went up to jerusalem
there also went with us some of the disciples from caesarea they brought with them a man named mnason a man from cyprus an early disciple with whom we would stay 
when we had arrived in jerusalem the brothers welcomed us gladly
the next day paul went with us to james and all the elders were present
when he had greeted them he reported one by one the things that god had done among the gentiles through his ministry 
when they heard it they glorified god and they said to him you see brother how many thousands have believed among the jews they are all zealous to keep the law
they have been told about you that you teach all the jews who live among the gentiles to abandon moses and that you tell them not to circumcise their children and not to walk according to the traditional ways 
what should we do they will certainly hear that you have come
so do what we say to you we have four men who made a vow
take these men and purify yourself with them and pay their expenses for them so that they may shave their heads so everyone will know that the things they have been told about you are false they will learn that you also live correctly obeying the law 
but concerning the gentiles who have believed we wrote about our decision that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols from blood from what is strangled and from sexual immorality
then paul took the men and the next day he purified himself along with them then they went into the temple giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering would be presented for each of them 
when the seven days were almost finished some jews from asia seeing paul in the temple stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him
they were shouting men of israel help us this is the man who teaches all men everywhere things that are against the people the law and this place besides he has also brought greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place
for they had previously seen trophimus the ephesian with him in the city and they thought that paul had brought him into the temple 
all the city was excited and the people ran together and laid hold of paul they dragged him out of the temple and the doors were immediately shut
as they were trying to kill him news came up to the chief captain of the company of soldiers that all jerusalem was in an uproar 
right away he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the crowd when the people saw the chief captain and the soldiers they stopped beating paul
then the chief captain approached and laid hold of paul and commanded him to be bound with two chains then he asked who he was and what he had done 
some in the crowd were shouting one thing and others another since the captain could not learn the truth because of all the noise he ordered that paul be brought into the fortress
when he came to the steps he was carried by the soldiers because of the crowds violence
for the crowd of people followed after and kept shouting out away with him 
as paul was about to be brought into the fortress he said to the chief captain is it permitted for me to say something to you the captain said do you know greek
are you not then the egyptian who some time ago started a rebellion and led the four thousand men of the assassins out into the wilderness 
paul said i am a jew from the city of tarsus in cilicia i am a citizen of no unimportant city i beg you allow me to speak to the people
when the captain had given him permission paul stood on the steps and motioned with the hand to the people when there was a deep silence he spoke to them in the hebrew language he said  
brothers and fathers listen to my defense which i will now make to you
when the crowd heard paul speak to them in the hebrew language they became quiet he said 
i am a jew born in tarsus of cilicia but educated in this city at the feet of gamaliel i was instructed according to the strict ways of the law of our fathers i am zealous for god just as all of you are today
i persecuted this way to the death binding up and delivering to prison both men and women
as the high priest and all the elders can testify i received letters from them for the brothers in damascus and i went there to bring them back in bonds to jerusalem to be punished 
it happened that when i was traveling and nearing damascus about noon suddenly a great light from heaven began to shine around me
i fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me saul saul why are you persecuting me
i answered who are you lord he said to me i am jesus of nazareth whom you are persecuting 
those who were with me saw the light but they did not understand the voice of him who spoke to me
i said what should i do lord the lord said to me arise and go into damascus there you will be told everything that has been appointed for you to do
i could not see because of that lights brightness and being led by the hands of those who were with me i came into damascus 
there i met a man named ananias a devout man according to the law and well spoken of by all the jews who lived there
he came to me stood by me and said brother saul receive your sight in that very hour i saw him 
then he said the god of our fathers has appointed you to know his will to see the righteous one and to hear the voice coming from his own mouth
for you will be a witness for him to all men about what you have seen and heard
now why are you waiting arise be baptized and wash away your sins calling on his name 
after i had returned to jerusalem and while i was praying in the temple a trance came on me
i saw him say to me hurry and leave jerusalem quickly because they will not accept your testimony about me 
i said lord they themselves know that i imprisoned and beat those who believed in you in every synagogue
when the blood of stephen your witness was spilled i also was standing by and agreeing and i was guarding the cloaks of those who killed him
but he said to me go because i will send you far away to the gentiles 
they listened to him until that statement then they raised their voices and said away with such a fellow from the earth for it is not right that he should live
as they were shouting throwing off their cloaks and throwing dust into the air
the chief captain commanded paul to be brought into the fortress he ordered that he should be questioned with scourging so that he himself might know why they were shouting against him like that 
when they had tied him up with the thongs paul said to the centurion who was standing by is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a roman and who has not been put on trial
when the centurion heard this he went to the chief captain and told him saying what are you about to do for this man is a roman citizen 
the chief captain came and said to him tell me are you a roman citizen paul said yes
the chief captain answered it was only with a large amount of money that i acquired citizenship but paul said i was born a roman citizen
then the men who were going to question him left him immediately the chief captain also was afraid when he learned that paul was a roman citizen because he had tied him up 
on the next day the chief captain wanted to know for certain about the jews accusations against paul so he untied his bonds and ordered the chief priests and all the council to meet then he brought paul down and placed him in their midst  
paul looked directly at the council members and said brothers i have lived before god in all good conscience until this day
the high priest ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth
then paul said to him god will strike you you whitewashed wall are you sitting to judge me by the law yet order me to be struck against the law 
those who stood by said is this how you insult gods high priest
paul said i did not know brothers that he was high priest for it is written you must not speak evil of a ruler of your people 
when paul saw that the one part of the council were sadducees and the other pharisees he spoke loudly in the council brothers i am a pharisee a son of pharisees it is because i have the hope of the resurrection of the dead that i am being judged
when he said this an argument began between the pharisees and sadducees and the crowd was divided
for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection no angels and no spirits but the pharisees acknowledge all of them 
so a large uproar occurred and some of the scribes belonging to the pharisees stood up and argued saying we find nothing wrong with this man what if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him
when there arose a great argument the chief captain feared that paul would be torn to pieces by them so he commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among the council members and bring him into the fortress 
the following night the lord stood beside him and said have courage for as you have testified about me in jerusalem so you must also testify in rome 
when it became day some jews formed a conspiracy and put themselves under an oath saying that they would not eat or drink anything until they had killed paul
there were more than forty men who formed this conspiracy 
they went to the chief priests and the elders and said we have sworn a great oath to eat nothing until we have killed paul
now therefore let the council formally request the chief captain to bring him down to you as if you would decide his case more precisely as for us we are ready to kill him before he comes here 
but pauls sisters son heard that they were lying in wait so he went and entered the fortress and told paul
paul called one of the centurions and said take this young man to the chief captain for he has something to report to him 
so the centurion took the young man and brought him to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you he has something to say to you
the chief captain took him by the hand to a private place and asked him what is it that you have to report to me 
the young man said the jews have agreed to ask you to bring down paul tomorrow to the council as if they were going to ask more precisely about his case
but do not be persuaded by them because there are more than forty men who are lying in wait for him they have put themselves under oath neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him even now they are ready waiting for your approval 
so the chief captain let the young man go after instructing him tell no one that you have reported these things to me
then he called to him two of the centurions and said get two hundred soldiers ready to go as far as caesarea and seventy horsemen also and two hundred spearmen you will leave at the third hour of the night
he also ordered them to provide animals which paul could ride and to take him safely to felix the governor 
then he wrote a letter like this
claudius lysias to the most excellent governor felix greetings
this man was arrested by the jews and was about to be killed by them when i came upon them with soldiers and rescued him since i learned that he was a roman citizen 
i wanted to know why they accused him so i took him down to their council
i learned that he was being accused about questions concerning their own law but that there was no accusation against him that deserved death or imprisonment
then it was reported to me that there was a plot against the man so i immediately sent him to you and instructed his accusers also to bring their charges against him in your presence farewell 
so the soldiers obeyed their orders they took paul and brought him by night to antipatris
on the next day most of the soldiers left the horsemen to go with him and they themselves returned to the fortress
when the horsemen reached caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor they also presented paul to him 
when the governor read the letter he asked what province paul was from when he learned that he was from cilicia
he said i will hear you fully when your accusers come here then he commanded him to be kept in herods government headquarters  
after five days ananias the high priest certain elders and an orator named tertullus went there these men brought charges against paul before the governor
when paul stood before the governor tertullus began to accuse him and said to the governor because of you we have great peace and your foresight brings good reform to our nation
so with all thankfulness we welcome everything that you do most excellent felix 
so that i detain you no more i beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly
for we have found this man to be a pest and one who causes all the jews throughout the world to rebel he is a leader of the nazarene sect
he even tried to desecrate the temple so we arrested him  some ancient copies add we wanted to judge him according to our law  
 some ancient copies have for verse  and the beginning of verse   but lysias the officer came and took him by force out of our hands  commanding his accusers to come to you 
when you examine paul about all these matters you will be able to learn about all the things of which we are accusing him
the jews also joined in the accusation affirming that these charges were true 
but when the governor motioned for paul to speak paul answered i understand that for many years you have been a judge to this nation and so i gladly explain myself to you
you can learn for yourself that it has not been more than twelve days since i went up to worship in jerusalem
when they found me in the temple i did not argue with anyone and i did not stir up a crowd either in the synagogues or in the city
they cannot prove to you the accusations they are now making against me 
but i confess this to you that according to the way which they call a sect i serve the god of our fathers believing all things that are according to the law and that has been written in the prophets
i have a hope in god which these men also have that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked
so i always strive to have a blameless conscience before god and human beings 
now after many years i came to give alms to my nation and present sacrifices
when i did this certain jews from asia found me in a purification ceremony in the temple not with a crowd or an uproar
these men ought to be before you now and accuse me if they have anything 
or else these same men should say what wrong they found in me when i stood before the jewish council
unless it is about this one thing that i shouted out when i stood among them it is concerning the resurrection of the dead that i am on trial before you today 
then felix who was well informed about the way postponed the hearing he said when lysias the commander comes down from jerusalem i will decide your case
then he commanded the centurion that paul should be kept in custody but to have some freedom so that none of his friends would be prevented from attending to his needs 
after some days felix returned with drusilla his wife who was jewish and he sent for paul and he heard from him about faith in christ jesus
but when paul reasoned with him about righteousness selfcontrol and the coming judgment felix became frightened and said go away for now but when i have time later on i will send for you 
at the same time he hoped that paul would give money to him so he often sent for him and spoke with him
but when two years passed porcius festus became the governor after felix but felix wanted to gain favor with the jews so he left paul bound  
now festus entered the province and after three days he went from caesarea up to jerusalem
the chief priests and the prominent jews brought their charges against paul and they asked festus earnestly
asking him to do them a favor against paulto summon him to jerusalem for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way 
festus answered that paul was being held in custody at caesarea and that he himself was going there soon
therefore those who can he said should go there with us if there is something wrong with the man you should accuse him 
festus stayed not more than eight or ten days and then he went down to caesarea and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat and commanded paul to be brought to him
when he arrived the jews from jerusalem stood nearby and they brought many serious charges which they could not prove
paul defended himself and said i have committed no sin against the law of the jews or against the temple or against caesar 
but festus wanted to gain the favor of the jews and so he answered paul and said do you want to go up to jerusalem and to be judged by me about these things there
paul said i stand before the judgment seat of caesar where i must be judged i have wronged no jews just as you also very well know 
though if i have done wrong and if i have done what is worthy of death i do not refuse to die but if their accusations are nothing no one can hand me over to them i appeal to caesar
after festus talked with the council he answered you have appealed to caesar to caesar you will go 
now after some days king agrippa and bernice arrived at caesarea to pay an official visit to festus
after they had been there for many days festus presented pauls case to the king he said a certain man was left behind here by felix as a prisoner
when i was in jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews brought charges against this man to me and they asked for a sentence of condemnation against him
i answered them that it was not the custom of the romans to hand over anyone before the accused had faced his accusers and received an opportunity to defend himself against the charges 
therefore when they came together here i did not wait but the next day i sat in the judgment seat and i ordered the man to be brought in
when the accusers stood up they charged him with nothing that i considered wickedness
instead they had certain disputes with him about their own religion and about a certain jesus who was dead whom paul claims to be alive
i was perplexed about how to investigate this matter and so i asked him if he would be willing to go to jerusalem to stand trial there about these charges 
but when paul appealed to be kept in custody while awaiting the decision of the emperor i ordered him to be held in custody until i could send him to caesar
agrippa spoke to festus i would also like to listen to this man tomorrow festus said you will hear him 
so on the next day agrippa and bernice came with much ceremony they came into the hall with the military officers and with the prominent men of the city when festus spoke the command paul was brought to them
festus said king agrippa and all you men who are here with us you see this man all the multitude of jews appealed to me in jerusalem and here also and they shouted to me that he should no longer live 
i found he had done nothing worthy of death but because he appealed to the emperor i decided to send him to rome
but i do not have anything certain to write to my lord for this reason i have brought him to you especially to you king agrippa so that i might have something more to write about the case
for it seems unreasonable for me to send a prisoner and to not also state the charges against him  
so agrippa said to paul you may speak for yourself then paul stretched out his hand and made his defense
i consider myself happy king agrippa to make my case before you today against all the accusations of the jews
especially because you are an expert in all the jewish customs and questions so i beg you to hear me patiently 
truly all the jews know how i lived from my youth in my own nation and at jerusalem
they have known about me from the beginning if they are willing to admit it that i lived as a pharisee the strictest party of our religion 
now i stand here to be judged because of my hope in the promise made by god to our fathers
it is this promise that our twelve tribes hope to receive as they worship god earnestly night and day and it is for this hope king that the jews are accusing me
why should any of you judge it to be incredible that god raises the dead 
now indeed i myself thought that i should do many things against the name of jesus of nazareth
i did these in jerusalem i locked up in prison many of gods holy people by the authority i received from the chief priests and when they were killed i cast my vote against them
i punished them many times in all the synagogues and i tried to force them to blaspheme i was furiously enraged against them and i persecuted them even to foreign cities 
while i was doing this i went to damascus with authority and orders from the chief priests
and on the way there in the middle of the day king i saw a light from heaven that was brighter than the sun and it shone around both me and the men who were traveling with me
when we all fell to the ground i heard a voice speaking to me that said in the hebrew language saul saul why do you persecute me it is hard for you to kick a goad 
then i said who are you lord the lord replied i am jesus whom you persecute
now get up and stand on your feet because for this purpose i appeared to you to appoint you to be a servant and a witness concerning the things that you know about me now and the things that i will show to you later
and i will rescue you from the people and from the gentiles to whom i am sending you
to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the dominion of satan to god so that they may receive from god the forgiveness of sins and the inheritance that i give to them who are sanctified by faith in me 
therefore king agrippa i did not disobey the heavenly vision
but to those in damascus first and then at jerusalem and throughout all the country of judea and also to the gentiles i gave them the message that that they should repent and turn to god doing deeds worthy of repentance
for this cause the jews arrested me in the temple and tried to kill me 
therefore i have received the help that comes from god until this very day and i stand and testify to both small and great about nothing more than what the prophets and moses said would happen
that christ must suffer and by being the first to rise from the dead he would proclaim light to our own people and to the gentiles 
as paul completed his defense festus said with a loud voice paul you are insane your great learning makes you insane
but paul said i am not insane most excellent festus but i am declaring words of truth and sound judgment
for the king knows about these things and so i speak boldly to him for i am persuaded that none of this is hidden from him for this has not been done in a corner 
do you believe the prophets king agrippa i know that you believe
agrippa said to paul in a short time would you persuade me and make me a christian
paul said i pray to god that whether in a short or long time not you only but also all that hear me today would be like me but without these prison chains 
then the king stood up and the governor and bernice also and those who were sitting with them
when they left the hall they talked to one another and said this man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds
agrippa said to festus this man could have been freed if he had not appealed to caesar  
when it was decided that we should sail for italy they committed paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named julius who belonged to the augustan company of soldiers
we boarded a ship from adramyttium which was about to sail along the coast of asia so we went to sea aristarchus from thessalonica in macedonia went with us 
the next day we landed at the city of sidon where julius treated paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to receive their care
from there we went to sea and sailed under the lee of cyprus close to the island because the winds were against us
when we had sailed across the sea past cilicia and pamphylia we landed at myra a city of lycia
there the centurion found a ship from alexandria that was going to sail to italy he put us on it 
when we had sailed slowly for many days and had finally arrived with difficulty near cnidus and the wind no longer allowed us to go that way we sailed along the sheltered side of crete opposite salmone
we sailed along the coast with difficulty until we came to a certain place called fair havens which is near the city of lasea 
we had now taken much time the time of the jewish fast also had passed and it had now become dangerous to sail so paul warned them
and said men i see that the voyage we are about to take will be with injury and much loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives
but the centurion was more persuaded by the master and by the owner of the ship than by those things that were spoken by paul 
because the harbor was not easy to spend the winter in most of the sailors advised to sail from there and if by any means we could reach the city of phoenix to spend the winter there phoenix is a harbor in crete facing both southwest and northwest
when a south wind began to blow gently the sailors thought that they had what they needed so they weighed anchor and sailed along crete close to the shore 
but after a short time a wind of hurricane force called the northeaster began to beat down from the island
when the ship was caught by the storm and could no longer head into the wind we had to give way to the storm and were driven along by the wind
we sailed along the lee of a small island called cauda and with difficulty we were able to secure the lifeboat 
when they had hoisted the lifeboat up they used its ropes to bind the hull of the ship they were afraid that they should run upon the sandbars of syrtis so they lowered the sea anchor and were driven along
we took such a violent battering by the storm that the next day they began throwing the cargo overboard 
on the third day the sailors threw overboard the ships equipment with their own hands
when the sun and stars did not shine on us for many days and the great storm still beat upon us any more hope that we should be saved was abandoned 
when they had gone long without food then paul stood up among the sailors and said men you should have listened to me and not have set sail from crete so as to get this injury and loss
now i urge you to take courage for there will be no loss of life among you but only the loss of the ship 
for last night an angel of the god to whom i belong whom also i worshiphis angel stood beside me
and said do not be afraid paul you must stand before caesar and see god in his kindness has given to you all those who are sailing with you
therefore have courage men for i trust god that it will happen just as it was told to me
but we must run aground upon some island 
when the fourteenth night had come as we were driven this way and that in the adriatic sea about midnight the sailors thought that they were approaching some land
they took soundings and found twenty fathoms after a little while they took more soundings and found fifteen fathoms
they were afraid that we might crash on the rocks so they lowered four anchors from the stern and prayed that morning would come soon 
the sailors were looking for a way to abandon the ship and had lowered the lifeboat into the sea and pretended that they would throw down the anchors from the bow
but paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers unless these men stay in the ship you cannot be saved
then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let it drift away 
when daylight was coming on paul encouraged them all to take some food he said this day is the fourteenth day that you have been on constant guard and have gone without foodyou have not eaten anything
so i urge you to share some food for this is necessary for you to survive for not one of you will lose a single hair from his head
when he had said this he took bread and he thanked god in the sight of everyone then he broke the bread and began to eat 
then they were all encouraged and they also took food
we were  souls on the ship
when they had eaten enough they made the ship lighter by throwing out the wheat into the sea 
when it was day they did not recognize the land but they saw a bay with a beach and they discussed whether they could drive the ship onto it
so they cut loose the anchors and left them in the sea at the same time they loosed the ropes of the rudders and raised the foresail to the wind and so they headed to the beach
but the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground the bow was stuck there and remained unmovable and the stern was broken up by the force of the waves 
the soldiers plan was to kill the prisoners so that none of them could swim away and escape
but the centurion wanted to save paul so he stopped their plan and he ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land
then the rest of the men should follow some on planks and some on other things from the ship in this way it happened that all of us were brought safely to land  
when we were brought safely through we learned that the island was called malta
the native people offered to us not just ordinary kindness but they lit a fire and welcomed us all because of the constant rain and cold 
but when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and placed them on the fire a viper came out because of the heat and fastened onto his hand
when the native people saw the animal hanging from his hand they said one to another this man certainly is a murderer who has been saved from the sea justice does not permit him to live 
but then he shook the animal into the fire and suffered no harm
they were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead but after they watched him for a long time and saw that nothing was wrong with him they changed their minds and said that he was a god 
now in a nearby place there were lands belonging to the chief man of the island a man named publius he welcomed us and kindly provided for us for three days
it happened that the father of publius was lying afflicted with a fever and dysentery when paul went to him he prayed placed his hands on him and healed him
after this happened the rest of the people on the island who were sick also came and were healed
the people also honored us with many honors when we were preparing to sail they gave us what we needed 
after three months we set sail in a ship that had spent the winter at the island a ship of alexandria with the twin gods as its figurehead
after we landed at the city of syracuse we stayed there three days 
from there we sailed and arrived at the city of rhegium after one day a south wind sprang up and in two days we came to the city of puteoli
there we found some brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days in this way we came to rome
from there the brothers after they heard about us came to meet us as far as the market of appius and the three taverns when paul saw the brothers he thanked god and took courage 
when we entered rome paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier who was guarding him
then it came about that after three days paul called together those men who were the leaders among the jews when they had come together he said to them brothers although i have done nothing wrong against the people or the customs of our fathers i was delivered as a prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans
after they questioned me they wished to set me free because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case 
but when the jews spoke against their desire i was forced to appeal to caesar although it is not as if i were bringing any accusation against my nation
for this reason therefore i called upon you that i might see you and speak with you since it is because of the hope of israel that i am now wearing this chain 
then they said to him we neither received letters from judea about you nor did any of the brothers come and report or say anything bad about you
but we want to hear from you what you think about this sect because it is known by us that it is spoken against everywhere 
when they had appointed a day for him more people came to him at his dwelling place he presented the matter to them and testified about the kingdom of god he tried to persuade them about jesus both from the law of moses and from the prophets from morning until evening
some were convinced about the things which were said while others did not believe 
when they did not agree with one another they left after paul had spoken this one word the holy spirit spoke well through isaiah the prophet to your fathers
he said go to this people and say  hearing you will hear but you will never understand  seeing you will see but you will never know 
for the heart of this people has become dull  and with their ears they hardly hear  and they have shut their eyes otherwise they might see with their eyes  and hear with their ears  and understand with their heart and turn again and i would heal them 
therefore you should know that this salvation of god has been sent to the gentiles and they will listen
 acts some ancient copies have verse  when he had said these things the jews went away they were having a great dispute among themselves  
paul lived for two whole years in his own rented house and he welcomed all who came to him
he was proclaiming the kingdom of god and was teaching the things about the lord jesus christ with all boldness without being hindered.
paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of god
which he promised beforehand by his prophets in the holy scriptures
concerning his son who was a descendant of david according to the flesh 
through the spirit of holiness he was declared with power to be the son of god by the resurrection from the dead jesus christ our lord
through him we have received grace and apostleship for obedience of faith among all the nations for the sake of his name
among these nations you also have been called to belong to jesus christ 
to all in rome who are beloved of god and called to be his holy people grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ 
first i thank my god through jesus christ for all of you because your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world
for god is my witness whom i serve in my spirit in the gospel of his son of how continually i make mention of you
i always request in my prayers that by any means i may at last be successful now by the will of god in coming to you 
for i desire to see you that i may give you some spiritual gift in order to strengthen you
that is i long to be mutually encouraged among you through each others faith yours and mine 
now i do not want you to be uninformed brothers that i often intended to come to you but i was hindered until now in order to have some fruit among you also just as i have had among the rest of the gentiles
i am a debtor both to greeks and to foreigners both to the wise and to the foolish
so as for me i am ready to proclaim the gospel also to you who are in rome 
for i am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of god for salvation for everyone who believes for the jew first and for the greek
for in it gods righteousness is revealed from faith to faith as it has been written the righteous will live by faith 
for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people who through unrighteousness hold back the truth
this is because that which is known about god is visible to them for god has enlightened them 
for ever since the creation of the world his invisible qualities namely his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen having been discerned in the things that have been made so they are without excuse
this is because although they knew about god they did not glorify him as god nor did they give him thanks instead they became foolish in their thoughts and their senseless hearts were darkened 
they claimed to be wise but they became foolish
they exchanged the glory of the imperishable god for the likenesses of an image of perishable man of birds of fourfooted beasts and of creeping things 
therefore god delivered them over to the lusts of their hearts for uncleanness for their bodies to be dishonored among themselves
it is they who exchanged the truth of god for a lie and who worshiped and served the creation instead of the creator who is blessed forever amen 
because of this god delivered them over to dishonorable lusts for their women exchanged natural relations for those that were unnatural
in the same way the men also left their natural relations with women and burned in their lust for one another these were men who committed shameless acts with men and received in themselves the penalty they deserved for their error 
and just as they did not approve of having god in their awareness he gave them up to a corrupted mind for them to do those things that are not proper 
they have been filled with all unrighteousness wickedness covetousness and malice they are full of envy murder strife deceit and evil intentions they are gossips
slanderers haters of god insolent arrogant boastful inventing ways of doing evil they are disobedient to parents
they are senseless faithless heartless and unmerciful 
they understand the ordinance of god that those who practice such things are deserving of death but not only do they do these things they also approve of others who do them  
therefore you are without excuse you person you who judge for in things for which you judge the other person you condemn yourself for you who judge practice the same things
but we know that gods judgment is according to truth when it falls on those who practice such things 
but consider this you person you who judge those who practice such things although you do the same things will you escape from the judgment of god
or do you think so little of the riches of his kindness his delayed punishment and his patience do you not know that his kindness is meant to lead you to repentance 
but it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart that you are storing up for yourself wrath on the day of wrath that is the day of the revelation of gods righteous judgment
he will pay back to every person according to his actions
to those who according to the perseverance of good deeds have sought glory honor and incorruptibility he will give eternal life 
but to those who are selfseeking who disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness wrath and fierce anger will come
god will bring tribulation and distress on every human soul that has practiced evil to the jew first and also to the greek 
but glory honor and peace will come to everyone who practices good to the jew first and also to the greek
for there is no partiality with god
for as many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law and as many as have sinned with respect to the law will be judged by the law 
for it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before god but it is the doers of the law who will be justified
for when gentiles who do not have the law do by nature the things of the law they are a law to themselves although they do not have the law 
by this they show that the actions required by the law are written in their hearts their conscience also bears witness to them and their own thoughts either accuse or defend them
on the day when god will judge the secrets of all people according to my gospel through jesus christ 
but if you say that you are a jew and rest upon the law and boast in god
and know his will and approve of what is excellent because you have been instructed from the law
and if you are convinced that you yourself are a guide to the blind a light to those who are in darkness
an instructor of the foolish a teacher of little children and that you have in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth then how does this affect the way you live your life 
you who teach others do you not teach yourself you who preach against stealing do you steal
you who say that one must not commit adultery do you commit adultery you who hate idols do you rob temples 
you who boast in the law do you dishonor god by transgressing the law
for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you just as it has been written 
for circumcision is profitable to you if you obey the law but if you are a transgressor of the law your circumcision becomes uncircumcision
if then the uncircumcised person keeps the requirements of the law will not his uncircumcision be considered as circumcision
and will not the one who is naturally uncircumcised condemn you if he fulfills the law this is because you have the written law and circumcision yet you are a transgressor of the law 
for he is not a jew who is merely one outwardly neither is circumcision that which is merely outward in the flesh
but he is a jew who is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit not in the letter the praise of such a person comes not from people but from god  
then what advantage does the jew have and what is the benefit of circumcision
it is great in every way first of all the jews were entrusted with revelation from god 
for what if some jews were without faith will their unbelief nullify gods faithfulness
may it never be instead let god be found to be true even though every man is a liar as it has been written that you might be shown to be righteous in your words  and that you might prevail when you come into judgment 
but if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of god what can we say can we say that god is unrighteous to bring his wrath upon us i am using a human argument
may it never be for then how would god judge the world 
but if through my lie the truth of god increases his glory why am i still being judged as a sinner
why not say as we are slandered as saying and as some affirm that we say let us do evil so that good may come their condemnation is just 
what then are we excusing ourselves not at all for we have already accused both jews and greeks all of them of being under sin 
this is as it is written no one is righteous not one  
there is no one who understands  there is no one who seeks god
they have all turned away  together they have become useless there is no one who does good no  not even one 
their throat is an open grave  their tongues have deceived the poison of snakes is under their lips 
their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness 
their feet are swift to pour out blood 
destruction and suffering are in their paths
these people have not known a way of peace 
there is no fear of god before their eyes 
now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to the ones who are under the law so that every mouth may be shut and the whole world held accountable to god
for no flesh will be justified by the works of the law in his sight for through the law comes the knowledge of sin 
but now apart from the law the righteousness of god has been revealed to which the law and the prophets bear witness
the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ for all those who believe for there is no distinction 
for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
and they are freely justified by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus 
for god provided christ jesus as an atoning sacrifice through faith in his blood he offered christ as proof of his justice because of his disregard of previous sins
in his patience this was to show his righteousness at this present time so he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in jesus 
where then is boasting it is excluded through what kind of law of works no but through a law of faith
we conclude then that a person is justified by faith without works of the law 
or is god the god of jews only is he not also the god of gentiles yes of gentiles also
if indeed god is one he will justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith 
do we then nullify the law through faith may it never be instead we uphold the law  
what then will we say that abraham our forefather according to the flesh found
for if abraham had been justified by works he would have had a reason to boast but not before god
for what does the scripture say abraham believed god and it was counted to him as righteousness 
now for him who labors his wage is not counted as a gift but as what is owed
but for him who does not work but instead believes in the one who justifies the ungodly his faith is counted as righteousness 
david also pronounces blessing on the man to whom god counts righteousness without works
he says blessed are those  whose lawless deeds are forgiven  and whose sins are covered
blessed is the man  against whom the lord will not count sin 
then is this blessing pronounced only on those of the circumcision or also on those of the uncircumcision for we say faith was counted to abraham as righteousness
how was it counted to him was it before or after he had been circumcised it was not after but before 
abraham received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised the purpose was to make him the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised so that righteousness would be counted to them
he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father abraham had before he was circumcised 
for the promise to abraham and to his descendants that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith
for if those who live by the law are to be the heirs faith is made empty and the promise does nothing
for the law brings about wrath but where there is no law there is no transgression 
for this reason it is by faith in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all of abrahams descendantsnot only to those who are under the law but also to those who share the faith of abraham he is the father of us all
as it is written i have appointed you the father of many nations abraham was in the presence of him whom he trusted that is god who gives life to the dead and calls the things that do not exist into existence 
in hope he believed against hope that he would become the father of many nations according to what he had been told so will your descendants be
without becoming weak in faith he considered his own body as dead because he was about a hundred years old and the deadness of sarahs womb 
but because of gods promise abraham did not hesitate in unbelief instead he was strengthened in faith and gave glory to god
he was fully convinced that what god had promised he was also able to accomplish
therefore this was also counted to him as righteousness 
but the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone
they were written also for us and it will be counted to us who believe in him who raised jesus our lord from the dead
this is the one who was delivered up for our trespasses and was raised for our justification  
since we are justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
through him we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand and we boast in the hope of the glory of god 
not only this but we also boast in our tribulations we know that tribulation brings about perseverance
perseverance produces character and character produces hope
and hope does not make ashamed because the love of god has been poured into our hearts through the holy spirit who was given to us 
for while we were still weak at the right time christ died for the ungodly
for one will hardly die for a righteous person though perhaps someone would dare to die for a good person 
but god proves his own love toward us because while we were still sinners christ died for us
much more then now that we are justified by his blood we will be saved by him from the wrath of god 
for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god through the death of his son much more after having been reconciled will we be saved by his life
not only this but we also rejoice in god through our lord jesus christ through whom we now have received this reconciliation 
so then as through one man sin entered into the world in this way death entered through sin and death spread to all people because all sinned
for until the law sin was in the world but there is no accounting for sin when there is no law 
nevertheless death reigned from adam until moses even over those who did not sin like adams disobedience who is a pattern of him who was to come
but the gift is not like the trespass for if by the trespass of one the many died how much more did the grace of god and the gift by the grace of the one man jesus christ abound for the many 
for the gift is not like the outcome of that one mans sin the judgment followed one trespass and brought condemnation but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification
for if by the trespass of the one death ruled through the one how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one jesus christ 
so then as one trespass led to condemnation for all people so also through the one act of righteousness came justification and life for all people
for as through the one mans disobedience the many were made sinners even so through the obedience of the one will the many be made righteous 
but the law came in to increase the trespass but where sin abounded grace abounded even more
this happened so that as sin reigned in death even so grace might reign through righteousness for everlasting life through jesus christ our lord  
what then will we say should we continue in sin so that grace may abound
may it never be we who died to sin how can we still live in it
do you not know that as many as were baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death 
we were buried then with him through baptism into death this happened in order that just as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father so also we might walk in newness of life
for if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death we will also be united with his resurrection 
we know this that our old man was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be destroyed this happened so that we should no longer be enslaved to sin
he who has died is declared righteous with respect to sin 
but if we have died with christ we believe that we will also live together with him
we know that since christ has been raised from the dead he cannot die again death no longer rules over him 
for in regard to the death that he died to sin he died once for all however the life that he lives he lives for god
in the same way you also must consider yourselves to be dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus 
therefore do not let sin rule in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts
do not present the members of your bodies to sin to be tools used for unrighteousness but present yourselves to god as those who have been brought from death to life and present the members of your bodies to god as tools to be used for righteousness
do not allow sin to rule over you for you are not under law but under grace 
what then are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace may it never be
do you not know that if you present yourselves as slaves you are slaves to the one whom you obey you are either slaves to sin which leads to death or slaves to obedience which leads to righteousness 
but thanks be to god for you were slaves of sin but you have obeyed from the heart the pattern of teaching that you were given
you have been made free from sin and you have been made slaves of righteousness 
i speak like a man because of the weakness of your flesh for just as you presented the members of your bodies as slaves to uncleanness and to lawlessness resulting in more lawlessness in the same way now present the members of your bodies as slaves to righteousness for sanctification
for when you were slaves of sin you were free from righteousness
at that time what fruit then did you have of the things of which you are now ashamed for the outcome of those things is death 
but now that you have been made free from sin and are enslaved to god you have your fruit for sanctification the result is eternal life
for the wages of sin are death but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord  
or do you not know brothers for i am speaking to people who know about law that the law rules over a person for whatever time he lives 
for the married woman is bound by law to the husband while he lives but if the husband dies she is released from the law of marriage
so then while her husband is living if she lives with another man she will be called an adulteress but if the husband dies she is free from the law so she is not an adulteress if she lives with another man 
therefore my brothers you were also made dead to the law through the body of christ this is so that you could be joined to another that is to him who was raised from the dead in order that we might produce fruit for god
for when we were in the flesh the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in the members of our bodies to bear fruit for death 
but now we have been released from the law we have died to that by which we were bound this is so that we might serve in newness of the spirit and not in oldness of the letter 
what will we say then is the law itself sin may it never be however i would never have known sin if it were not through the law for i would not have known covetousness unless the law said you must not covet
but sin took the opportunity through the commandment and produced every kind of coveting in me for apart from the law sin was dead 
at one time i was alive without the law but when the commandment came sin regained life
and i died the commandment that was to bring life turned out to be death for me 
for sin took the opportunity through the commandment and deceived me through the commandment it killed me
so the law is holy and the commandment is holy righteous and good 
so did what is good become death to me may it never be but sin in order that it might be shown to be sin brought about death in me through what was good and through the commandment sin might become sinful beyond measure
for we know that the law is spiritual but i am of the flesh i have been sold under slavery to sin 
for what i do i do not really understand for what i want to do i do not do and what i hate i do
but if i do what i do not want i agree with the law that the law is good 
but now it is no longer i who do it but the sin that lives in me
for i know that in me that is in my flesh lives no good thing for the desire for good is with me but i cannot do it 
for the good that i want i do not do but the evil that i do not want that i do
now if i do what i do not want to do then it is no longer i who am acting but rather sin that lives in me
so i find this law when i want to do good evil is present with me 
for i rejoice in the law of god with my inner person
but i see a different law in the members of my body it fights against that new law in my mind it takes me captive by the law of sin that is in the members of my body 
i am a miserable man who will deliver me from this body of death
but thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord so then i myself serve the law of god with my mind however with the flesh i serve the law of sin  
there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death 
for what the law was unable to do because it was weak through the flesh god did he sent his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be an offering for sin and he condemned sin in the flesh
he did this in order that the requirements of the law might be fulfilled in us we who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit
those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who live according to the spirit set their minds on the things of the spirit 
for the mind set on the flesh is death but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace
the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward god for it does not submit to gods law nor is it able to do so
those who are in the flesh cannot please god 
however you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if indeed gods spirit lives in you but if anyone does not have the spirit of christ he does not belong to him
if christ is in you the body is dead with respect to sin but the spirit is alive with respect to righteousness 
if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead lives in you he who raised christ from the dead will give life also to your mortal bodies through his spirit who lives in you 
so then brothers we are debtors but not to the flesh to live according to the flesh
for if you live according to the flesh you are about to die but if by the spirit you put to death the bodys actions you will live 
for as many as are led by the spirit of god these are sons of god
you did not receive a spirit of slavery so that you live in fear again but you received the spirit of adoption by which we cry abba father 
the spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of god
if we are children then we are also heirsheirs of god and we are joint heirs with christ if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him 
for i consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed to us
for the eager expectation of the creation waits for the revealing of the sons of god 
for the creation was subjected to futility not of its own will but because of him who subjected it in hope
that the creation itself will be delivered from slavery to decay and that it will be brought into the freedom of the glory of the children of god
for we know that the whole creation groans and labors in pain together even now 
not only that but even we ourselves who have the firstfruits of the spirit groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption the redemption of our body
for in this hope we were saved now hope that is seen is not hope for who hopes for what he can see
but if we hope for what we do not see we wait for it with patience 
in the same way the spirit also helps in our weakness for we do not know how we should pray but the spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groans
he who searches out the hearts knows the mind of the spirit because he intercedes on behalf of gods holy people according to the will of god 
we know that for those who love god he works all things together for good  instead of he works all things together for good  some greek copies read all things work together for good  for those who are called according to his purpose
because those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brothers
those whom he predestined these he also called those whom he called these he also justified those whom he justified these he also glorified 
what therefore can we say about these things if god is for us who is against us
he who did not spare his own son but delivered him up on behalf of us all how will he not also with him freely give us all things 
who will bring any accusation against gods chosen ones god is the one who justifies
who is the one who condemns christ jesus is the one who diedmore than that who was raisedwho is at the right hand of god and who also is interceding for us 
who will separate us from the love of christ tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword
just as it is written for your benefit we are killed all day long  we were considered as sheep for the slaughter 
in all these things we are more than conquerors through the one who loved us
for i have been convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things present nor things to come nor powers
nor height nor depth nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord  
i tell the truth in christ i do not lie and my conscience bears witness with me in the holy spirit
that for me there is great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart 
for i could wish that i myself would be cursed and set apart from christ for the sake of my brothers my kinsmen according to the flesh
they are israelites they have adoption the glory the covenants the gift of the law the ministry in the temple and the promises
theirs are the patriarchs from whom christ has come with respect to the fleshhe who is god over all may he be praised forever amen 
but it is not as though the word of god has failed for it is not everyone in israel who truly belongs to israel
neither are all abrahams descendants truly his children but it is through isaac that your descendants will be called 
that is the children of the flesh are not the children of god but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants
for this is the word of promise at this time i will come and a son will be given to sarah 
not only this but after rebekah also had conceived by one man our father isaac
for the children were not yet born and had not yet done anything good or bad so that the purpose of god according to choice might stand
not because of actions but because of him who callsit was said to her the older will serve the younger
it is just as had been written jacob i loved but esau i hated 
what then will we say is there unrighteousness with god may it never be
for he says to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy  and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion
so then it is not because of him who wills nor because of him who runs but because of god who shows mercy 
for the scripture says to pharaoh for this very purpose i raised you up so that i might demonstrate my power in you and so that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth
so then god has mercy on whom he wishes and whom he wishes he makes stubborn 
you will say then to me why does he still find fault for who has ever withstood his will
on the contrary man who are you who answers against god will what has been molded say to the one who molds it why did you make me this way
does the potter not have the right over the clay to make from the same lump a container for honorable use and another container for dishonorable use 
what if god who is willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much patience containers of wrath prepared for destruction
what if he did this in order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon containers of mercy which he had previously prepared for glory
what if he did this also for us whom he also called not only from among the jews but also from among the gentiles 
as he says also in hosea i will call them my people who were not my people  and her beloved who was not beloved
then it will be that where it was said to them  you are not my people  there they will be called sons of the living god 
isaiah cries out concerning israel though the number of the sons of israel were as the sand of the sea  it will be a remnant that will be saved
for the lord will execute his word  on the earth completely and without delay
as isaiah had said previously if the lord of hosts  had not left us descendants we would be like sodom  and we would have become like gomorrah 
what will we say then that the gentiles who were not pursuing righteousness laid hold of righteousness the righteousness by faith
but israel who did pursue a law of righteousness did not arrive at that law 
why not because they did not pursue it by faith but as if by works they stumbled over the stone of stumbling
as it has been written look i am laying in zion a stone of stumbling  and a rock of offense  he who believes in it will not be ashamed  
brothers my hearts desire and my plea to god is for them for their salvation
for i testify about them that they have a zeal for god but not according to knowledge
for failing to understand the righteousness that comes from god and seeking to establish their own righteousness they did not submit to gods righteousness 
for christ is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness for everyone who believes
for moses writes about the righteousness that comes from the law the man who does these things will live by them 
but the righteousness that comes from faith says this do not say in your heart who will ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down
and do not say who will descend into the abyss that is to bring christ up from the dead 
but what does it say the word is near you in your mouth and in your heart that is the word of faith which we proclaim
for if with your mouth you confess jesus as lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
for with the heart one believes and has righteousness and with the mouth one confesses and is saved 
for scripture says everyone who believes on him will not be put to shame
for there is no difference between jew and greek for the same lord is lord of all and he is rich to all who call upon him
for everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved 
how then can they call on him in whom they have not believed how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard how can they hear without a preacher
then how can they preach unless they are sentas it is written how beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim good news 
but not all of them obeyed the good news for isaiah says lord who has believed our report
so faith comes from hearing and hearing by the word of christ 
but i say did they not hear yes most certainly their sound has gone out into all the earth  and their words to the ends of the world 
moreover i say did israel not know first moses says i will provoke you to jealousy by what is not a nation  by means of a nation without understanding i will stir you up to anger 
then isaiah was very bold when he says i was found by those who did not seek me  i appeared to those who did not ask for me
but to israel he says all the day long i reached out my hands  to a disobedient and stubborn people  
i say then did god reject his people may it never be for i also am an israelite a descendant of abraham of the tribe of benjamin
god did not reject his people whom he foreknew do you not know what the scripture says about elijah how he pleaded with god against israel
lord they have killed your prophets they have broken down your altars i alone am left and they are seeking my life 
but what does gods answer say to him i have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bent the knee to baal
even so then at this present time also there is a remnant because of the choice of grace 
but if it is by grace it is no longer based on works otherwise grace would no longer be grace  some old copies read but if it is by works then it is no longer grace otherwise work is no longer work 
what then the thing that israel was seeking it did not obtain but the chosen obtained it and the rest were hardened
it is just as it is written god has given them a spirit of dullness  eyes so that they should not see and ears so that they should not hear  to this very day 
then david says let their table become a snare and a trap  a stumbling block and a retribution for them
let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see  and bend their backs continually 
i say then did they stumble so as to fall may it never be instead by their trespass salvation has come to the gentiles in order to provoke them to jealousy
now if their trespass is the riches of the world and if their loss is the riches of the gentiles how much greater will their fulfillment be 
but now i am speaking to you gentiles and as long as i am an apostle to the gentiles i take pride in my ministry
perhaps i will provoke to jealousy those who are of my own flesh perhaps we will save some of them 
for if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world what will their acceptance be but life from the dead
if the firstfruits are holy so is the lump of dough if the root is holy so are the branches 
but if some of the branches were broken off if you a wild olive branch were grafted in among them and if you shared with them in the rich root of the olive tree
do not boast over the branches but if you do boast it is not you who supports the root but the root that supports you 
you will say then branches were broken off so that i might be grafted in
that is true because of their unbelief they were broken off but you stand firm because of your faith do not be arrogant in your thoughts but fear
for if god did not spare the natural branches neither will he spare you 
look at then the kind actions and the severity of god severity came on the jews who fell but gods kindness comes on you if you continue in his kindness otherwise you also will be cut off 
and even they if they do not continue in their unbelief will be grafted in for god is able to graft them in again
for if you were cut out of what is by nature a wild olive tree and contrary to nature were grafted into a good olive tree how much more will these the natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree 
for i do not want you to be uninformed brothers of this mystery so that you may not be wise in your own thinking a partial hardening has come upon israel until the full number of the gentiles comes in 
thus all israel will be saved just as it is written out of zion will come the deliverer  he will remove ungodliness from jacob
and this will be my covenant with them  when i will take away their sins 
as far as the gospel is concerned they are enemies for your sake but as far as election is concerned they are beloved because of the patriarchs
for the gifts and the call of god are irrevocable 
for just as you were formerly disobedient to god now you have received mercy because of their disobedience
in the same way now these jews have been disobedient the result was that by the mercy shown to you they may also now receive mercy
for god has shut up all into disobedience in order that he might show mercy on all 
oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of god  how unsearchable are his judgments  and his ways beyond discovering
for who has known the mind of the lord  or who has become his advisor 
or who has first given anything to god  that god must repay him
for from him and through him and to him are all things  to him be the glory forever amen  
i urge you therefore brothers by the mercies of god to present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable to god this is your reasonable service
do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind do this so that you can test and approve what is the good acceptable and perfect will of god 
for by the grace that was given to me i say to everyone among you do not think of yourself more highly than you ought but rather think with sober judgment each according to the measure of faith that god has given you 
for we have many members in one body but not all the members have the same function
in the same way we who are many are one body in christ and are individually members of each other 
we have different gifts according to the grace that was given to us if ones gift is prophecy let it be done according to the proportion of his faith
if ones gift is service let him serve if one has the gift of teaching let him teach
if ones gift is encouragement let him encourage if ones gift is giving let him do it generously if ones gift is leading let it be done with diligence if ones gift is in showing mercy let it be done with cheerfulness 
let love be without hypocrisy abhor what is evil hold on to that which is good
concerning love of the brothers be affectionate to one another concerning honor respect one another 
concerning diligence do not be hesitant concerning the spirit be eager concerning the lord serve him
rejoice in hope endure tribulation be faithful in prayer
share in the needs of gods holy people find many ways to show hospitality 
bless those who persecute you bless and do not curse
rejoice with those who rejoice weep with those who weep
be of the same mind toward one another do not think in proud ways but accept lowly people do not be wise in your own thoughts 
repay no one evil for evil do good things in the sight of all people
if possible as far as it depends on you live at peace with all people 
do not avenge yourselves beloved but give way to the wrath of god for it is written vengeance belongs to me i will repay says the lord
but if your enemy is hungry feed him  if he is thirsty give him a drink for if you do this you will heap coals of fire on his head
do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good  
let every soul be subject to higher authorities for there is no authority unless it comes from god the authorities that exist have been appointed by god
therefore he who rebels against that authority opposes the command of god and those who oppose it will receive judgment on themselves 
for rulers are not a terror to those who do good deeds but to those who do evil deeds do you desire to have no fear of the one in authority do what is good and you will receive his praise
for he is a servant of god to you for good but if you do what is evil be afraid for he does not carry the sword for no reason for he is a servant of god an avenger for wrath on the one who does evil
therefore you must be subject not only because of the wrath but also because of conscience 
because of this you pay taxes also for authorities are servants of god who attend to this very thing continually
pay to everyone what is owed to them tax to whom tax is due toll to whom toll is due fear to whom fear is due honor to whom honor is due 
owe no one anything except to love one another for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law
the commandments do not commit adultery do not murder do not steal do not covet and if there is any other commandment it is summed up in this love your neighbor as yourself
love does no harm to a neighbor therefore love is the fulfillment of the law 
because of this you know the time that it is already the hour for you to awake out of sleep for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed
the night has advanced and the day is near let us therefore put aside the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light 
let us walk appropriately as in the day not in drunken celebrations or drunkenness and let us not walk in sexual immorality or in uncontrolled lust and not in strife or jealousy
but put on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its lusts  
receive anyone who is weak in faith without giving judgment about arguments
one person has faith to eat anything another who is weak eats only vegetables 
may the one who eats everything not despise the one who does not and may the one who does not eat everything not judge the other who eats everything for god has accepted him
who are you you who judge a servant belonging to someone else it is before his own master that he stands or falls but he will be made to stand for the lord is able to make him stand 
one person values one day above another another has concluded that every day is equal let each person be convinced in his own mind
he who observes the day observes it for the lord and he who eats eats for the lord for he gives thanks to god he who does not eat refrains from eating for the lord he also gives thanks to god 
for none of us lives for himself and none dies for himself
for if we live we live for the lord and if we die we die for the lord then whether we live or die we are the lords
for to this purpose christ died and lived again that he might be lord of both the dead and those who are living 
but you why do you judge your brother and you why do you despise your brother for we will all stand before the judgment seat of god
for it is written as i live says the lord  to me every knee will bend  and every tongue will confess to god 
so then each one of us will give an account of himself to god
therefore let us no longer judge one another but instead decide this that no one will place a stumbling block or a snare for his brother 
i know and am persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean by itself only for him who considers anything to be unclean for him it is unclean
if because of food your brother is hurt you are no longer walking in love do not destroy with your food one for whom christ died 
so do not allow what you consider to be good to be spoken of as evil
for the kingdom of god is not about food and drink but about righteousness peace and joy in the holy spirit 
for the one who serves christ in this way is acceptable to god and approved by people
so then let us pursue the things of peace and the things that build up one another 
do not destroy the work of god on account of food all things are clean but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone to stumble
it is good not to eat meat nor to drink wine nor to do anything over which your brother stumbles 
the faith you have keep between yourself and god blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves
he who doubts is condemned if he eats because it is not from faith and whatever is not from faith is sin  
now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak and ought not to please ourselves
let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good in order to build him up 
for even christ did not please himself instead it was just as it is written the insults of those who insulted you fell on me
for whatever was previously written was written for our instruction in order that through patience and through encouragement of the scriptures we would have hope 
now may the god of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with each other according to christ jesus
may he do this in order that with one mind you may glorify with one mouth the god and father of our lord jesus christ
therefore receive one another even as christ also received you to the glory of god 
for i say that christ has been made a servant of the circumcision on behalf of gods truth in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs
and for the gentiles to glorify god for his mercy as it is written therefore i will give praise to you among the gentiles  and sing praise to your name 
again it says rejoice you gentiles with his people
and again praise the lord all you gentiles  let all the peoples praise him 
again isaiah says the root of jesse will come  the one who rises to rule over the gentiles  in him the gentiles will have hope 
now may the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing so that by the power of the holy spirit you may abound in hope 
i myself am also convinced about you my brothers i am convinced that also you yourselves are full of goodness filled with all knowledge i am convinced that you are also able to instruct one another 
but i am writing more boldly to you about some things in order to remind you again because of the grace given me by god
this grace was that i should be a servant of christ jesus sent to the gentiles to offer as a priest the gospel of god so that the offering of the gentiles might become acceptable sanctified by the holy spirit 
in christ jesus i have reason to boast of my service for god
for i will not dare to speak of anything except what christ has accomplished through me for the obedience of the gentiles these are things done by word and action
by the power of signs and wonders and by the power of the spirit of god this was so that from jerusalem and round about as far as illyricum i might fully carry out the gospel of christ 
in this way my desire has been to proclaim the gospel but not where christ is known by name in order that i might not build upon another mans foundation
it is as it is written those to whom no report of him came will see him  and those who have not heard will understand 
therefore i was also hindered many times from coming to you
but now i no longer have any place in these regions and i have been longing for many years to come to you 
i hope to see you when i pass through there on my way to spain and to be helped by you on my journey there once i have enjoyed your company for a while
but now i am going to jerusalem serving gods holy people 
for it was the good pleasure of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution to the poor among gods holy people who are in jerusalem
yes it was their good pleasure and they owe it to them for if the gentiles have shared in their spiritual things they owe it to the jews to minister to them with their material things 
therefore when i have completed this task and have made sure that they receive all that was collected i will go to spain and visit you on the way
i know that when i come to you i will come in the fullness of the blessing of christ 
now i urge you brothers by our lord jesus christ and by the love of the spirit that you strive together with me in your prayers to god for me
pray that i may be rescued from those who are disobedient in judea and that my service for jerusalem may be acceptable to gods holy people
pray that i may come to you in joy through the will of god and that i may together with you find rest 
may the god of peace be with you all amen  
i commend to you phoebe our sister who is a servant of the church that is in cenchreae
in order that you may receive her in the lord do this in a manner worthy of gods holy people and provide her with whatever help she may need from you for she has been a great help to many and to myself as well

now i urge you brothers to watch out for those who cause divisions and stumbling contrary to the teaching that you have learned turn away from them
for people such as these do not serve our lord christ but their own stomach by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the innocent 
for your example of obedience reaches everyone i rejoice therefore over you but i want you to be wise as to that which is good and innocent to that which is evil
the god of peace will soon crush satan under your feet the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you 
timothy my fellow worker greets you and lucius jason and sosipater my kinsmen
i tertius who write this epistle down greet you in the lord 
gaius the host for me and for the whole church greets you erastus the treasurer of the city greets you with quartus the brother
 the best ancient copies do not have this phrase may the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen  so verese  is not included in the ulb 
now to him who is able to make you strong according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery that had been kept secret for long ages
but now has been revealed and made known through the prophetic writings to all nations by the command of the eternal god to bring about the obedience of faith 
to the only wise god, through jesus christ, be glory forever. amen.
paul called by christ jesus to be an apostle by the will of god and sosthenes our brother
to the church of god at corinth those who have been sanctified in christ jesus and called to be holy people together with all those in every place who call on the name of our lord jesus christ who is their lord and ours
may grace and peace be to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ 
i always give thanks to my god for you because of the grace of god that christ jesus gave to you
he has made you rich in every way in all speech and with all knowledge
just as the testimony about christ has been confirmed as true among you 
therefore you lack no spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for the revelation of our lord jesus christ
he will also strengthen you to the end so that you will be blameless on the day of our lord jesus christ
god is faithful who called you into the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord 
now i urge you brothers through the name of our lord jesus christ that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you i urge that you be joined together with the same mind and by the same purpose
for i have been informed concerning you my brothers by chloes people that there are factions among you 
i mean this each one of you says i am with paul or i am with apollos or i am with cephas or i am with christ
is christ divided was paul crucified for you were you baptized into the name of paul 
i thank god that i baptized none of you except crispus and gaius
this was so that no one would say that you were baptized into my name
i also baptized the household of stephanas beyond that i do not know if i baptized any others 
for christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospelnot with clever speech in order that the cross of christ would not be emptied of its power 
for the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but among those who are being saved it is the power of god
for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise  i will set aside the understanding of the intelligent 
where is the wise person where is the scholar where is the debater of this world has not god turned the wisdom of the world into foolishness
since the world in its wisdom did not know god god was pleased to save those who believe through the foolishness of preaching 
for jews ask for miraculous signs and greeks seek wisdom
but we preach christ crucified a stumbling block to jews and foolishness to gentiles 
but to those whom god has called both jews and greeks we preach christ as the power and the wisdom of god
for the foolishness of god is wiser than people and the weakness of god is stronger than people 
look at your calling brothers not many of you were wise according to the flesh not many of you were powerful not many of you were of noble birth
but god chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise god chose what is weak in the world to shame what is strong 
god chose what is low and despised in the world he even chose things that are regarded as nothing to bring to nothing things that are held as valuable
he did this so that no flesh would have a reason to boast before him 
because of what god did now you are in christ jesus who became for us wisdom from god he became our righteousness holiness and redemption
as a result as it is written let the one who boasts boast in the lord  
when i came to you brothers i did not come with eloquence of speech or wisdom as i proclaimed hidden truths about god  a few important and ancient greek copies read as i proclaimed the testimony about god 
for i decided to know nothing when i was among you except jesus christ and him crucified 
and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling
and my message and my proclamation were not with persuasive words of wisdom but with the demonstration of the spirit and of power
so that your faith might not be in the wisdom of humans but in the power of god 
now we do speak wisdom among the mature but not the wisdom of this world or of the rulers of this age who are passing away
instead we speak gods wisdom in hidden truth the hidden wisdom that god predestined before the ages for our glory 
none of the rulers of this age understood it for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the lord of glory
but as it is written no eye has seen  no ear has heard no human heart has imagined  what god has prepared for those who love him 
for god has revealed these things to us through the spirit for the spirit searches everything out even the deep things of god  some ancient greek copies say but god  howevever following our greek source it readsfor god 
for who knows a persons thoughts except the spirit of the person in him so also no one knows the deep things of god except the spirit of god 
but we did not receive the spirit of the world but the spirit who is from god so that we might know the things freely given to us by god
we speak about these things in words not taught by human wisdom but by the spirit interpreting spiritual things to spiritual people 
the unspiritual person does not receive the things that belong to the spirit of god for they are foolishness to him he cannot understand them because they are spiritually discerned
the one who is spiritual judges all things but he is not judged by others
for who can know the mind of the lord  that he can instruct him but we have the mind of christ  
and i brothers could not speak to you as to spiritual people but instead as to fleshly people as to little children in christ
i fed you milk not solid food for you were not ready for it and even now you are not yet ready 
for you are still fleshly for where jealousy and strife exist among you are you not living according to the flesh and are you not walking by human standards
for when one says i follow paul and another says i follow apollos are you not merely human beings
who then is apollos who is paul servants through whom you believed just as the lord gave tasks to each 
i planted and apollos watered but god gave the growth
so then neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything but it is god who gives the growth 
now he who plants and he who waters are one and each will receive his own wages according to his own labor
for we are gods fellow workers you are gods garden gods building 
according to the grace of god that was given to me as a skilled master builder i laid a foundation and another is building on it but let each man be careful how he builds on it
for no one can lay a foundation other than the one that has been laid that is jesus christ 
now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold silver precious stones wood hay or straw
his work will be revealed for the day will reveal it for it will be revealed in fire the fire will test the quality of what each one has done 
if anyones work remains he will receive a reward
but if anyones work is burned up he will suffer loss but he himself will be saved as though escaping through fire 
do you not know that you are gods temple and that the spirit of god lives in you
if anyone destroys gods temple god will destroy that person for gods temple is holy and so are you 
let no one deceive himself if anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age let him become a fool that he may become wise
for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written he catches the wise in their craftiness
and again the lord knows that the reasoning of the wise is futile 
for this reason let no one boast in men all things are yours
whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all things are yours
and you are christs and christ is gods  
this is how a person should regard us as servants of christ and stewards of the hidden truths of god
now what is required of stewards is that they are found to be trustworthy 
but for me it is a very small thing that i should be judged by you or by any human court for i do not even judge myself
i am not aware of any charge being made against me but that does not justify me the one who judges me is the lord 
therefore do not pronounce judgment about anything before the time before the lord comes he will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the purposes of the heart then each one will receive his praise from god 
now brothers i applied these principles to myself and apollos for your sakes so that from us you might learn the meaning of the saying do not go beyond what is written this is so that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against the other
for who sees any difference between you and others what do you have that you did not receive if you have received it why do you boast as if you did not receive it 
already you have all you could want already you have become rich you began to reignand that quite apart from us indeed i wish you did reign so that we could reign with you
for i think god has put us apostles on display as the last in line in a procession and like men sentenced to death we have become a spectacle to the worldto angels and to human beings 
we are fools for christs sake but you are wise in christ we are weak but you are strong you are held in honor but we are held in dishonor
up to this present hour we are hungry and thirsty we are poorly clothed we are beaten and we are homeless 
we labor hard working with our own hands when we are slandered we bless when we are persecuted we endure
when we are slandered we speak with kindness we have become as the refuse of the world and the filthiest of all things even till now 
i do not write these things to shame you but to warn you as my beloved children
for even if you have ten thousand guardians in christ you do not have many fathers for i became your father in christ jesus through the gospel
so i urge you to be imitators of me 
that is why i sent you timothy my beloved and faithful child in the lord he will remind you of my ways in christ just as i teach them everywhere and in every church
now some of you have become puffed up acting as though i were not coming to you 
but i will come to you soon if the lord wills then i will know not merely the words of these who are so puffed up but i will see their power
for the kingdom of god does not consist in words but in power
what do you want should i come to you with a rod or with love and in a spirit of gentleness  
we heard a report that there is sexual immorality among you a kind of immorality that is not even permitted among the pagans a man has his fathers wife
you are puffed up should you not mourn instead so that the one who did this deed might be removed from among you 
for even though i am absent in body i am present in spirit i have already passed judgment on the one who did this just as though i were there
when you are assembled in the name of our lord jesus and i am with you in spirit and the power of our lord jesus is present
deliver this man over to satan for the destruction of the flesh so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the lord 
your boasting is not good do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole loaf
cleanse yourselves of the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough unleavened just as you really are for christ our passover lamb has been sacrificed
so let us then celebrate the festival not with the old yeast the yeast of bad behavior and wickedness instead let us celebrate with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth 
i wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people
in no way did i mean the immoral people of this world or the greedy or swindlers or idolaters since to stay away from them you would need to go out of the world 
but now i am writing to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother but who is living in sexual immorality or who is greedy or is an idolater or is verbally abusive or is a drunkard or a swindler do not even eat a meal with such a person
for how am i involved with judging those who are outside the church instead are you not to judge those who are inside the church
but god judges those who are on the outside remove the evil person from among you  
when one of you has a dispute against another does he dare to bring a lawsuit before the unrighteous rather than before gods holy people
do you not know that gods holy people will judge the world if then you will judge the world are you not able to settle matters of little importance
do you not know that we will judge the angels how much more then can we judge matters of this life 
if then you have to make judgments that pertain to daily life why do you lay such cases as these before those who have no standing in the church
i say this to your shame is there no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between brothers
but one brother brings a lawsuit against another brotherand this before unbelievers 
the fact that you have lawsuits with one another is already a defeat for you why not rather suffer the wrong why not rather allow yourselves to be cheated
but you yourselves do wrong and you cheat and you do this to your own brothers 
do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who submit to homosexual acts nor men who perform homosexual acts
nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of god
that is what some of you were like but you have been cleansed you have been sanctified you have been justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of our god 
everything is lawful for me but not everything is profitable everything is lawful for me but i will not be mastered by any of them
food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food but god will do away with both of them the body is not intended for sexual immorality instead the body is for the lord and the lord will provide for the body 
god both raised the lord and will also raise us up by his power
do you not know that your bodies are members of christ should i then take the members of christ and join them to a prostitute may it not be 
do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her as scripture says the two will become one flesh
but he who is joined to the lord becomes one spirit with him 
run away from sexual immorality every other sin that a person commits is outside the body but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body 
do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit who lives within you whom you have from god do you not know that you are not your own
for you were bought with a price therefore glorify god with your body and in your spirit which belong to god  
now concerning the issues you wrote about it is good for a man not to touch a woman
but because of temptations for many immoral acts each man should have his own wife and each woman should have her own husband 
the husband should fulfill his duty to have sexual relations with his wife and in the same way the wife to her husband
it is not the wife who has authority over her own body it is the husband in the same way the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does 
do not deprive each other except by mutual agreement and for a specific period of time do this so that you may devote yourselves to prayer then you should come together again so that satan may not tempt you because of your lack of selfcontrol
but i say these things to you as a concession and not as a command
i wish that everyone were as i am but each one has his own gift from god one has this kind of gift and another that kind 
to the unmarried and to widows i say that it is good for them if they remain unmarried as i am
but if they cannot exercise selfcontrol they should marry for it is better for them to marry than to burn with passion 
now to the married i give this commandnot i but the lordthe wife should not separate from her husband
but if she does separate from her husband she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband and the husband should not divorce his wife 
but to the rest i sayi not the lordthat if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and if she is content to live with him he should not divorce her
if a woman has an unbelieving husband and if he is content to live with her she should not divorce him
for the unbelieving husband is set apart because of his wife and the unbelieving wife is set apart because of the brother otherwise your children would be unclean but actually they are set apart 
but if the unbeliever departs let him go in such cases the brother or sister is not bound to their vows god has called us to live in peace
for how do you know woman whether you will save your husband or how do you know man whether you will save your wife 
however as the lord has given each one his portion let each one walk as god has called him this is my rule in all the churches
was anyone circumcised when he was called to believe he should not try to appear uncircumcised was anyone uncircumcised when he was called to faith he should not be circumcised
for it is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision that matters what matters is obeying the commandments of god 
each one should remain in the calling he was in when god called him to believe
were you a slave when god called you do not be concerned about it but if you can become free take advantage of it
for someone who is called by the lord as a slave is the lords freeman in the same way the one who was free when he was called to believe is christs slave
you have been bought with a price so do not become slaves of men
brothers in whatever situation he was in when he was called let each one remain with god in that 
now concerning virgins i have no commandment from the lord but i give my opinion as one who by the lords mercy is trustworthy
therefore i think that because of the disaster that is coming it is good for a man to remain as he is 
are you bound to a wife do not seek a divorce if you are free of a wife do not seek a wife
but if you do marry you have not sinned and if a virgin marries she has not sinned but those who do will have many kinds of fleshly trouble and i want to spare you from this 
but this i say brothers the time is short from now on let those who have wives live as though they had none
those who weep should act as though they were not weeping and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing and those who buy as though they did not possess anything
and those who use the world should not act as though they are using it to the full for the world in its present form is coming to an end 
i would like you to be free from worries the unmarried man is concerned about the things of the lord how to please him
but the married man is concerned about the things of the world how to please his wife
he is divided the unmarried woman or the virgin is concerned about the things of the lord how to be set apart in body and in spirit but the married woman is concerned about the things of the world how to please her husband 
i say this for your own benefit and not to put any constraint on you i say this for what is right so that you may be devoted to the lord without any distraction 
but if anyone thinks that he is not treating his virgin with respectif she is beyond the age of marriage and it must be sohe should do what he wants he is not sinning they should marry
but if he is standing firm in his heart if he is not under pressure but can control his own will and if he has decided in his own heart to do this to keep his own a virgin he will do well
so the one who marries his virgin does well and the one who chooses not to marry will do even better 
a woman is bound to her husband while he lives but if her husband dies she is free to marry anyone she wishes but only in the lord
yet in my judgment she would be happier if she lives as she is and i think that i also have the spirit of god  
now concerning food sacrificed to idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffs up but love builds up
if anyone thinks he knows something that person does not yet know as he should know
but if anyone loves god that person is known by him 
therefore concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols we know that an idol in this world is nothing and that there is no god but one
for even if there were socalled gods either in heaven or on earth just as there are many gods and many lords
yet for us there is only one god the father from whom are all things and for whom we live and one lord jesus christ through whom all things exist and through whom we exist 
however this knowledge is not in everyone instead some previously practiced idol worship and they eat this food as if it were something sacrificed to an idol their conscience is thereby defiled because it is weak 
but food will not present us to god we are not worse if we do not eat nor better if we do eat it
but take care that your freedom does not become a reason for someone who is weak in faith to stumble
for suppose that someone sees you who have knowledge eating a meal in an idols temple is not his weak conscience emboldened to eat what is offered to idols 
so because of your understanding about the true nature of idols the weaker one the brother for whom christ died is destroyed
thus when you sin against your brothers and wound their weak consciences you sin against christ
therefore if food causes my brother to stumble i will never eat meat again so that i may not cause my brother to fall  
am i not free am i not an apostle have i not seen jesus our lord are you not my work in the lord
if i am not an apostle to others at least i am to you for you are the seal of my apostleship in the lord 
this is my defense to those who examine me
do we not have the right to eat and drink
do we not have the right to take along a wife who is a believer as do the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the lord and cephas
or do only i and barnabas not have the right to not work at a trade 
who serves as a soldier at his own expense who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit or who shepherds a flock and does not drink milk from it
do i say these things based on human authority does not the law also say this 
for it is written in the law of moses do not put a muzzle on an ox when it is threshing the grain is it really the oxen that god cares about
is he not speaking about us it was written for us because the one who plows should plow in hope and the one who threshes should thresh in the hope of sharing in the harvest
if we sowed spiritual things among you is it too much for us to reap physical things from you 
if others exercised this right from you do we not have even more but we did not claim this right instead we endured everything rather than be a hindrance to the gospel of christ
do you not know that those who perform sacred duties get their food from the temple do you not know that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar
in the same way the lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living from the gospel 
but i have not claimed any of these rights and i do not write this so something might be done for me it would be better for me to die thanno one will make my boast empty
for if i preach the gospel i have no reason for boasting because i must do this and woe be to me if i do not preach the gospel 
for if i do this willingly i have a reward but if not willingly i still have a stewardship that was entrusted to me
what then is my reward that when i preach i may offer the gospel without charge and so not take full use of my right in the gospel 
for though i am free from all i became a servant to all in order that i might win more
to the jews i became like a jew in order to win jews to those under the law i became like one under the law in order to win those under the law i did this even though i myself was not under the law  the ulb has i did this even though i myself was not under the law  a few important and ancient greek copies with other ancient translations leave this sentence out 
to those outside the law i became like one outside the law although i was not outside the law of god myself but under the law of christ i did this so that i may win those outside the law
to the weak i became weak so that i may win the weak i have become all things to all people so that i may by all means save some
i do all things for the gospels sake so that i may participate in its blessings 
do you not know that in a race all the runners run the race but that only one receives the prize so run to win the prize
every athlete exercises selfcontrol in all things they do it to receive a wreath that is perishable but we do it to receive one that is imperishable
therefore this is how i run as not without purpose this is how i box not as one beating the air
but i subdue my body and make it a slave so that after i have preached to others i myself may not be disqualified  
i do not want you to be uninformed brothers that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea
all were baptized into moses in the cloud and in the sea
and all ate the same spiritual food
all drank the same spiritual drink for they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ 
but god was not well pleased with most of them and their corpses were scattered about in the wilderness
now these things were examples for us so we would not be those who lust for evil things as they lusted 
do not be idolaters as some of them were this is as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play
let us not commit sexual immorality as many of them did in one day twentythree thousand people died because of it 
neither let us put christ to the test as many of them tested him and were destroyed by snakes
also do not grumble as many of them did and were destroyed by an angel of death 
now these things happened to them as examples for us they were written for our instructionfor us on whom the end of the ages has come
therefore let anyone who thinks he stands be careful that he does not fall
no temptation has overtaken you that is not common to all humanity instead god is faithful he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape so that you may be able to endure it 
therefore my beloved ones run away from idolatry
i speak to you as people who have understanding so you may judge what i say
the cup of blessing that we bless is it not a sharing in the blood of christ the bread that we break is it not a sharing in the body of christ
because there is one loaf of bread we who are many are one body we all take of one loaf of bread together 
look at the israel that is according to the flesh are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar
what am i saying then that an idol is anything or that food sacrificed to an idol is anything 
but i say about the things they sacrifice that they offer these things to demons and not to god i do not want you to be participants with demons
you cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of demons you cannot participate at the table of the lord and the table of demons
or do we provoke the lord to jealousy are we stronger than he is 
everything is lawful but not everything is profitable everything is lawful but not everything builds people up
no one should seek his own good instead each one should seek the good of his neighbor 
eat everything sold in the market without asking questions of conscience
for the earth is the lords and the fullness of it
if an unbeliever invites you to eat a meal and you wish to go eat whatever is set before you without asking questions of conscience 
but if someone says to you this has been offered in sacrifice then do not eat it both for the sake of the one who informed you and for the sake of conscience  some ancient copies of the greek text add for the earth and everything in it belong to the lord  but the best ancient copies of the greek text do not have this many scholars see this addition as a duplication of verse 
the conscience of the other man i mean and not yours for why should my freedom be judged by anothers conscience
if i partake of the meal with gratitude why am i being insulted for that for which i gave thanks 
therefore whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do all to the glory of god
be blameless both to jews and to greeks and to the church of god
in the same way i try to please all people in all things i do not seek my benefit but that of the many i do this so that they may be saved  
be imitators of me just as i am an imitator of christ
now i praise you because you remember me in everything i praise you because you hold firmly to the traditions just as i delivered them to you
now i want you to understand that christ is the head of every man that a man is the head of a woman and that god is the head of christ
any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head 
but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head for it is the same thing as if her head were shaved
for if a woman will not cover her head she should cut her hair short if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or for her to shave her head let her cover her head 
for a man should not have his head covered since he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man
for man was not made from woman instead woman was made from man 
for neither was man created for woman instead woman was created for man
this is why the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels 
nevertheless in the lord the woman is not independent from the man nor is the man independent from the woman
for as the woman comes from the man so does the man come from the woman and all things come from god 
judge for yourselves is it proper for a woman to pray to god with her head uncovered
does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a dishonor for him
does not nature teach you that if a woman has long hair it is her glory for her hair has been given to her as a covering
but if anyone wants to argue about this we do not have any other practice nor do the churches of god 
but in the following instructions i do not praise you for when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse
for in the first place i hear that when you come together in the church there are divisions among you and in part i believe it
for there must also be factions among you so that those who are approved may become evident among you 
for when you come together it is not the lords supper that you eat
when you eat each one eats his own food before the others have their meal one is hungry and another becomes drunk
do you not have houses to eat and to drink in do you despise the church of god and humiliate those who have nothing what should i say to you should i praise you i will not praise you for this 
for i received from the lord what i also passed on to you that the lord jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread
after he had given thanks he broke it and said this is my body which is for you do this to remember me 
in the same way he took the cup after supper and he said this cup is the new covenant in my blood do this as often as you drink it to remember me
for every time you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the lords death until he comes 
whoever therefore eats the bread or drinks the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord
let a person examine himself first and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup
for he who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment to himself
that is why many among you are weak and ill and some of you have fallen asleep 
but if we examine ourselves we will not be judged
but when we are judged by the lord we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world 
therefore my brothers when you come together to eat wait for one another
if anyone is hungry let him eat at home so that when you come together it will not be for judgment and about the other things you wrote i will give instructions when i come  
about spiritual gifts brothers i do not want you to be uninformed
you know that when you were pagans you were led astray to idols who could not speak in whatever ways you were led by them
therefore i want you to know that no one who speaks by the spirit of god can say jesus is accursed no one can say jesus is lord except by the holy spirit 
now there are different gifts but the same spirit
there are different ministries but the same lord
and there are different kinds of work but it is the same god who works all in all 
now to each one is given the outward display of the spirit for the benefit of all
for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom and to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit 
to another is given faith by the same spirit and to another gifts of healing by the one spirit
to another is given miraculous works and to another prophecy to another is given the ability to distinguish between spirits to another various kinds of tongues and to another the interpretation of tongues
all these are the work of one and the same spirit giving the gifts to each one individually as he chooses 
for as the body is one and has many members and all are members of the same body so it is with christ
for by one spirit we were all baptized into one body whether jews or greeks whether slave or free and all were made to drink of one spirit 
for the body is not a single member but many
if the foot says since i am not the hand i am not part of the body it is not any less a part of the body
and if the ear says because i am not an eye i am not part of the body it is not any less a part of the body
if the whole body were an eye where would the sense of hearing be if the whole body were an ear where would the sense of smell be 
but god has appointed each member each one of them into the body as he has desired
if they were all the same member where would the body be
so now they are many members but only one body 
the eye cannot say to the hand i have no need of you nor does the head say to the feet i have no need of you
but the members of the body that appear to be weaker are essential
and the parts of the body that we think are less honorable we give them greater honor and our unpresentable members have more dignity
now our presentable members have no such need rather god has composed the body giving greater honor to those members that lack it 
he did this so there may be no division within the body but that the members should care for one another with the same affection
so when one member suffers all the members suffer together or when one member is honored all the members rejoice together
now you are the body of christ and individually members of it 
and god has appointed in the church first apostles second prophets third teachers then those who do miracles then gifts of healing those who provide helps those who do the work of administration and those who have various kinds of tongues
are all of them apostles are all prophets are all teachers do all do miracles 
do all of them have gifts of healing do all of them speak with tongues do all of them interpret tongues
zealously seek the greater gifts and now i will show you a more excellent way  
suppose that i speak with the tongues of men and of angels but if i do not have love i have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal
suppose that i have the gift of prophecy and understand all hidden truths and knowledge and that i have all faith so as to remove mountains but if i do not have love i am nothing
suppose that i give all my possessions to feed the poor and that i give my body to be burned but if i do not have love i gain nothing  most important and ancient greek copies as well as ancient translations read i give my body to be burned  there are a few important and ancient greek copies as well as ancient translations that read i give my body so that i might boast  
love is patient and kind love is not jealous and does not boast it is not puffed up
or rude it does not seek its own it is not provoked nor does it keep a count of wrongs
it does not rejoice in unrighteousness instead it rejoices in the truth
love bears all things believes all things hopes all things and endures all things 
love never ends if there are prophecies they will pass away if there are tongues they will cease if there is knowledge it will pass away
for we know in part and we prophesy in part
but when the perfect comes that which is incomplete will pass away 
when i was a child i spoke like a child i thought like a child i reasoned like a child when i became an adult i put away childish things
for now we see indirectly in a mirror but then face to face now i know in part but then i will know fully just as i have been fully known
but now these three remain faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love  
pursue love and be zealous for spiritual gifts especially that you may prophesy
for the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to god for no one understands him because he speaks mysteries in the spirit
but the one who prophesies speaks to people to build them up to exhort them and to comfort them
the one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself but the one who prophesies builds up the church 
now i wish that you all spoke in tongues but even more than that i wish that you would prophesy the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues unless someone interprets so that the church may receive edification
but now brothers if i come to you speaking in tongues how will i benefit you i cannot unless i speak to you with revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching 
in the same way when lifeless instruments are producing soundslike the flute or the harpif they do not produce different tones how will anyone know what tune the flute or harp is playing
for if the trumpet is played with an uncertain sound how will anyone know when it is time to prepare for battle
it is the same way for you with the tongue if you utter speech that is not clear how will what is said be understood you will be speaking into the air 
there are doubtless many kinds of languages in the world and none is without meaning
but if i do not know the meaning of a language i will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker will be a foreigner to me 
so it is with you since you are eager for the manifestations of the spirit seek for the edification of the church so that you might abound
so the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret
for if i pray in a tongue my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful 
what am i to do i will pray with my spirit but i will also pray with my mind i will sing with my spirit and i will also sing with my mind
otherwise if you bless god with the spirit how will the outsider say amen when you are giving thanks if he does not know what you are saying 
for you certainly give thanks well enough but the other person is not built up
i thank god that i speak in tongues more than all of you
but in the church i would rather speak five words with my understanding so that i might instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue 
brothers do not be children in your thinking rather in regard to evil be like infants but in your thinking be mature
in the law it is written by men of strange tongues  and by the lips of strangers i will speak to this people  even then they will not hear me  says the lord 
so then tongues are a sign not to believers but to unbelievers but prophecy is for a sign not for unbelievers but for believers
if therefore the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues and outsiders and unbelievers come in would they not say that you are insane 
but if you all were prophesying and an unbeliever or an outsider came in he would be convicted by all he hears he would be judged by all that is said
the secrets of his heart would be revealed as a result he would fall on his face and worship god he would declare that god is really among you 
what is next then brothers when you come together each one has a psalm a teaching a revelation a tongue or an interpretation do everything so that you build up the church
if anyone speaks in a tongue let there be two or at most three and each one in turn and then someone should interpret what is said
but if there is no one to interpret let each of them keep silent in the church let each one speak to himself alone and to god 
let two or three prophets speak and let the others listen with discernment to what is said
but if there is a revelation to one who is sitting let the first be silent 
for each of you can prophesy one by one so that each one may learn and all may be exhorted
for the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets
for god is not a god of confusion but of peace  this is the rule in all the churches of gods holy people
the women should keep silent in the churches for they are not permitted to speak instead they should be in submission as also the law says
if there is anything they desire to learn let them ask their husbands at home for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church
did the word of god come from you are you the only ones it has reached 
if anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual he should acknowledge that the things i write to you are a command of the lord
but if anyone does not recognize this let him not be recognized 
so then brothers earnestly desire to prophesy and do not forbid anyone from speaking in tongues
but let all things be done properly and in order  
now i want to make known to you brothers the gospel i proclaimed to you which you received and on which you stand
and by which you are being saved if you hold firmly to the word i preached to you unless you believed in vain 
for i delivered to you as of first importance what i also received that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures
that he was buried and that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures 
christ appeared to cephas and then to the twelve
then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once most of them are still alive but some have fallen asleep
then he appeared to james then to all the apostles 
last of all he appeared to me as if to one born prematurely
for i am the least of the apostles i am unworthy to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god 
but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace in me was not in vain instead i labored harder than all of them yet it was not i but the grace of god that is with me
therefore whether it is i or they so we preach and so you believed 
now if christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead
but if there is no resurrection of the dead then not even christ has been raised
and if christ has not been raised then our preaching is in vain and your faith also is in vain 
also we are found to be false witnesses about god because we testified that god raised christ from the dead but he did not raise him if indeed the dead are not raised
for if the dead are not raised not even christ has been raised
and if christ has not been raised your faith is in vain and you are still in your sins 
then those who have fallen asleep in christ have also perished
if only in this life we hope in christ of all people we are most to be pitied 
but now christ has been raised from the dead as the firstfruits of those who sleep
for since death came by a man by a man also came the resurrection of the dead 
for as in adam all die so also in christ all will be made alive
but each in his own order christ who is the firstfruits and then those who belong to christ will be made alive at his coming 
then will be the end when he will hand over the kingdom to god the father when he will abolish all rule and all authority and power
for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet
the last enemy to be destroyed is death 
for he has put everything under his feet but when it says he has put everything it is clear that this does not include the one who put everything in subjection under him
when all things are subjected under him then the son himself will be subjected under the one who put all things into subjection under him that god may be all in all 
or else what will those do who are baptized for the dead if the dead are not raised at all why are they baptized for them
why then are we in danger every hour 
i die every day this is as sure as my boasting in you which i have in christ jesus our lord
what do i gain from a human point of view if i fought with beasts at ephesus if the dead are not raised let us eat and drink  for tomorrow we die 
be not deceived bad company corrupts good morals
sober up live righteously do not keep sinning for some of you have no knowledge of god i say this to your shame 
but someone will say how are the dead raised and with what kind of body will they come
you fool what you sow will not come to life unless it dies 
what you sow is not the body that will be but a bare grain it may become wheat or something else
but god will give it a body as he chooses and to each seed its own body
not all flesh is the same instead there is one flesh for human beings and another flesh for animals and another flesh for birds and another for fish 
there are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies but the glory of the heavenly body is one kind and the glory of the earthly is another
there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differs from another star in glory 
so also is the resurrection of the dead what is sown is perishable and what is raised is imperishable
it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power
it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body if there is a natural body there is also a spiritual body 
so also it is written the first man adam became a living soul the last adam became a lifegiving spirit
but the spiritual did not come first but the natural and then the spiritual 
the first man is of the earth made of dust the second man is from heaven
just as the one made from dust is so also are those who are made of the dust and as the man of heaven is so also are those who are of heaven
just as we have borne the image of the man of dust we will also bear the image of the man of heaven 
now this i say brothers that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does what is perishable inherit what is imperishable
look i tell you a mystery we will not all sleep but we will all be changed 
we will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed
for this perishable body must put on what is imperishable and this mortal body must put on immortality 
but when this perishable body has put on what is imperishable and when this mortal body has put on immortality then will come about the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory
death where is your victory  death where is your sting 
the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law
but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ 
therefore my dear brothers be steadfast and immovable always abound in the work of the lord because you know that your labor in the lord is not in vain  
now concerning the collection for gods holy people as i instructed the churches of galatia so you are to do
on the first day of the week each of you is to put something aside and store it up as he may prosper do this so that there will be no collections when i come 
when i arrive to whomever you approve i will give letters of introduction to them and will send them with your gift to jerusalem
if it is appropriate for me to go also they will go with me 
but i will come to you when i pass through macedonia for i will pass through macedonia
perhaps i may stay with you or even spend the winter so that you may help me on my way wherever i go 
for i do not wish to see you now for only a passing visit for i hope to spend more time with you if the lord permits
but i will stay in ephesus until pentecost
for a wide door has opened for me and there are many adversaries 
now when timothy comes see that he is with you unafraid for he is laboring at the work of the lord as i am doing
let no one despise him help him on his way in peace so that he may come to me for i am expecting him to come along with the brothers
now concerning our brother apollos i strongly encouraged him to visit you with the brothers but it was not at all his will that he come now however he will come when the time is right 
be watchful stand fast in the faith act like men be strong
let all that you do be done in love 
you know the household of stephanas that they were the firstfruits of achaia and that they have devoted themselves to the service of gods holy people now i urge you brothers
to be in submission to such people and to everyone who helps in the work and labors with us 
i rejoice at the coming of stephanas fortunatus and achaicus they have made up for your absence
for they have refreshed my spirit and yours so then acknowledge people like them 
the churches of asia send greetings to you aquila and priscilla greet you in the lord with the church that is in their home
all the brothers greet you greet one another with a holy kiss 
i paul write this with my own hand
if anyone does not love the lord may he be accursed our lord come
the grace of the lord jesus be with you
my love be with you all in christ jesus.  a few important and ancient greek copies and some ancient translations have amen at the end of verse . but many important ancient greek copies, as well as many ancient translations, do not have amen at the end.
paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and timothy our brother to the church of god that is in corinth and to all gods holy people in the entire region of achaia
may grace be to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ 
may the god and father of our lord jesus christ be praised he is the father of mercies and the god of all comfort
god comforts us in all our tribulation so that we can comfort those who are in any tribulation we comfort others with the same comfort that god used to comfort us 
for just as the sufferings of christ abound for our sake so also our comfort abounds through christ
but if we are afflicted it is for your comfort and salvation and if we are comforted it is for your comfort your comfort is working effectively in your endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer
our hope concerning you is unshaken for we know that as you share the sufferings you also share our comfort 
for we do not want you to be uninformed brothers about the tribulation we had in asia we were utterly burdened beyond our strength so that we despaired even of life
indeed we had the sentence of death on us but that was to make us not put our trust in ourselves but instead in god who raises the dead
he rescued us from such a deadly peril and he will rescue us on him we have set our hope that he will rescue us 
he will do this as you also help us by your prayer then many will give thanks on our behalf for the favor given to us through the prayers of many 
our boast is this our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world with integrity and godly sincerity not relying on fleshly wisdom but on the grace of god
we write to you nothing that you cannot read and understand and i hope that you will fully understand
as you have understood us in part that you can boast of us on the day of our lord jesus just as we will boast of you 
because i was confident about this i wanted to come to you first so that you might receive a second favor
i was planning to visit you on my way to macedonia then i wanted to visit you again on my trip from macedonia and then for you to send me on my way to judea 
when i was thinking this way was i hesitating do i plan things according to the flesh so that i say yes yes and no no at the same time
but just as god is faithful our word to you is not yes and no 
for the son of god jesus christ whom silvanus timothy and i proclaimed among you is not yes and no instead he is always yes
for all the promises of god are yes in him so also through him we say amen to the glory of god 
now it is god who confirms us with you in christ and he anointed us
he set his seal on us and he gave us the spirit in our hearts as a guarantee of what is to come 
but i call god as witness to my soul that the reason i did not come to corinth was so that i might spare you
this is not because we want to be lords over your faith instead we are fellow laborers with you for your joy as you stand firm in your faith  
so i decided for my own part that i would not again come to you in sorrow
if i caused you sorrow who could make me glad but the very one who was made sorrowful by me 
i wrote as i did in order that when i came to you i might not be hurt by those who should have made me rejoice i have confidence about all of you that my joy is the same joy you all have
for i wrote to you from great tribulation with anguish of heart and with many tears i did not write you so that you would be made sorrowful instead i wanted you to know the depth of the love that i have for you 
if anyone has caused sorrow he has caused sorrow not only to me but in some measurenot to burden youto all of you
this punishment of that person by the majority is enough
so now rather than punish him you should forgive and comfort him do this so that he is not overwhelmed by too much sorrow 
so i exhort you to confirm your love for him
this was the reason i wrote so that i might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything 
if you forgive anyone i forgive that person as well what i have forgivenif i have forgiven anythingit is forgiven for your sake in the presence of christ
this is so that satan will not trick us for we are not ignorant of his schemes 
a door was opened to me by the lord when i came to the city of troas to preach the gospel of christ there
i had no relief in my spirit because i did not find my brother titus there so i left them and went on to macedonia 
but may thanks be to god who in christ always leads us in triumph through us he reveals the sweet aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere
for we are to god the sweet aroma of christ both among those who are saved and among those who are perishing 
to the people who are perishing it is an aroma from death to death to the ones being saved it is an aroma from life to life who is worthy of these things
for we are not like so many people who sell the word of god for profit instead with purity of motives we speak in christ as we are sent from god in the sight of god  
are we beginning to praise ourselves again we do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you like some people do we
you yourselves are our letter of recommendation written on our hearts known and read by all people
you show that you are a letter from christ the result of our ministry it was written not with ink but by the spirit of the living god it was not written on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts 
and this is the confidence that we have through christ before god
we are not competent in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us rather our competence is from god
it is god who made us able to be servants of a new covenant this is a covenant not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kills but the spirit gives life 
now the ministry of deathengraved in letters on stonescame in such glory that the sons of israel could not look directly at moses face this is because of the glory of his face a glory that was fading
how much more glorious will the ministry of the spirit be 
for if the ministry of condemnation had glory how much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory
for indeed that which was once made glorious is no longer glorious in this respect because of the glory that exceeds it
for if that which was passing away had glory how much more will what is permanent have glory 
since we have such a hope we are very bold
we are not like moses who put a veil over his face so that the sons of israel were not able to look directly at the ending of a glory that was passing away 
but their minds were hardened for to this day when they read the old covenant that same veil remains it has not been removed because only in christ is it taken away
but even today whenever moses is read a veil covers their hearts
but when a person turns to the lord the veil is taken away 
now the lord is the spirit where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom
now all of us with unveiled faces see the glory of the lord we are being transformed into the same glorious likeness from one degree of glory into another just as from the lord who is the spirit  
therefore because we have this ministry and just as we have received mercy we do not become discouraged
instead we have rejected secret and shameful ways we do not walk in craftiness and we do not mishandle the word of god but by presenting the truth we recommend ourselves to everyones conscience in the sight of god 
but if our gospel is veiled it is veiled only to those who are perishing
in their case the god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds as a result they are not able to see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god 
for we do not proclaim ourselves but christ jesus as lord and ourselves as your servants for jesus sake
for god is the one who said light will shine out of darkness he has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the presence of jesus christ 
but we have this treasure in jars of clay so that it is clear that the exceedingly great power belongs to god and not to us
we are afflicted in every way but not overwhelmed we are perplexed but not filled with despair
we are persecuted but not abandoned struck down but not destroyed
always carrying around in our body the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also be revealed in our body 
for we who are alive are always being given over to death for jesus sake so that the life of jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh
so death is at work in us but life is at work in you 
but we have the same spirit of faith according to that which was written i believed and so i spoke we also believe and so we also speak
because we know that the one who raised the lord jesus will also raise us with jesus and bring us with you into his presence
for everything is for your sake so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to increase to the glory of god 
so we do not become discouraged even though outwardly we are wasting away inwardly we are being renewed day by day
for this momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal burden of glory that exceeds all measurement
for we are not watching for things that are seen but for things that are unseen the things that we can see are temporary but the things that are unseen are eternal  
we know that if our earthly housethe tentis destroyed we have a building from god it is a house not made by human hands but an eternal house in heaven
for in this tent we groan longing to be clothed with our heavenly residence
we long for this because by putting it on we will not be found to be naked 
for indeed while we are in this tent we groan being burdened we do not want to be unclothed instead we want to be clothed so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life
the one who prepared us for this very thing is god who gave us the spirit as a guarantee of what is to come 
therefore always be confident knowing that while we are at home in the body we are away from the lord
for we walk by faith not by sight
so we have confidence we would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the lord 
so we make it our goal whether we are at home or away to please him
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ so that each one may receive what is due for the things done in the body whether for good or for bad 
therefore knowing the fear of the lord we persuade people what we are is clearly seen by god and i hope that it is also clear to your conscience
we are not commending ourselves to you again but we are giving you a reason to be proud of us so you may have an answer for those who boast about appearances but not about what is in the heart 
for if we are out of our minds it is for god and if we are in our right minds it is for your sake
for the love of christ controls us because we have concluded this that one person died for all and that therefore all have died
he died for all so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised 
for this reason from now on we do not regard anyone according to the flesh even though we once regarded christ according to the flesh but now we no longer regard him that way
therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old things have passed away see they have become new 
all these things are from god he reconciled us to himself through christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation
that is in christ god is reconciling the world to himself not counting their trespasses against them he is entrusting to us the message of reconciliation 
so we are appointed as representatives of christ as though god were making his appeal through us we plead with you for the sake of christ be reconciled to god
he made him who knew no sin to become sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of god in him  
working together with him we also urge you not to receive the grace of god in vain
for he says in a favorable time i paid attention to you  and in the day of salvation i helped you look now is the favorable time look now is the day of salvation
we do not place a stumbling block in front of anyone for we do not wish our ministry to be discredited 
instead in every way we commend ourselves as gods servants in much endurance in affliction in distress in hardship
in beatings in imprisonments in riots in hard labor in sleepless nights in hunger
in purity in knowledge in patience in kindness in the holy spirit in sincere love
in the word of truth in the power of god with the armor of righteousness for the right hand and the left 
we are gods servants in glory and dishonor in slander and praise regarded as deceivers and yet truthful
as unknown yet well known as dying yet lookwe live as being disciplined yet not killed
as sorrowful yet rejoicing as poor yet many are enriched as having nothing yet possessing all things 
we have spoken the whole truth to you corinthians and our heart is wide open
you are not restrained by us but you are restrained in your own hearts
now in fair exchangei speak as to childrenopen yourselves wide also 
do not be yoked together with unbelievers for what association does righteousness have with lawlessness for what fellowship does light have with darkness
what agreement can christ have with belial or what share does a believer have together with an unbeliever
and what agreement is there between the temple of god and idols for we are the temple of the living god just as god said i will dwell among them  and walk among them i will be their god  and they will be my people 
therefore come out from among them  and be set apart says the lord touch no unclean thing  and i will welcome you
i will be a father to you  and you will be my sons and daughters  says the lord almighty  
beloved since we have these promises let us cleanse ourselves of all defilement of flesh and spirit let us perfect holiness in the fear of god 
make room for us we have not wronged anyone we have not corrupted anyone or taken advantage of anyone
it is not to condemn you that i say this for i have already said that you are in our hearts for us to die together and to live together
i have great confidence in you and great is my boast about you i am filled with comfort i overflow with joy even in all our tribulation 
when we came to macedonia our bodies had no rest instead we were troubled in every way by conflicts on the outside and fears on the inside
but god who comforts the lowly comforted us by the arrival of titus
it was not only by his arrival that god comforted us it was also by the comfort that titus had received from you he told us of your great affection your sorrow and your zeal for me so i rejoiced even more 
even though my letter made you sorrowful i do not regret it but i did regret it when i saw that my letter made you sorrowful though only for a little while
now i rejoice not because you were sorrowful but because your sorrow brought you to repentance you experienced a godly sorrow so you suffered no loss because of us
for godly sorrow brings about repentance that accomplishes salvation without regret worldly sorrow however brings about death 
see what great diligence this godly sorrow produced in you how great was the determination in you to prove you were innocent how great was your indignation your fear your longing your zeal and your desire to see that justice should be done in everything you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter
although i wrote to you i did not write for the sake of the wrongdoer nor for the one who suffered the wrong but so that your earnestness toward us should be made known to you in the sight of god 
it is by this that we are encouraged in addition to our own comfort we also rejoiced even more because of titus joy because his spirit was refreshed by all of you
for if i boasted to him about you i was not put to shame on the contrary just as everything we said to you was true our boasting about you to titus proved to be true 
his affection for you is even greater as he remembers the obedience of all of you how you welcomed him with fear and trembling
i rejoice because i have complete confidence in you  
we want you to know brothers about the grace of god that has been given to the churches of macedonia
during a great test of tribulation the abundance of their joy and the extremity of their poverty have produced great riches of generosity 
for i testify that they gave as much as they were able and even beyond what they were able and of their own free will
they begged us with much earnestness for the privilege of sharing in this service to gods holy people
this did not happen as we had hoped but they first gave themselves to the lord and then to us by the will of god 
so we urged titus who had already begun this task to complete among you this act of grace
but you abound in everythingin faith in speech in knowledge in all diligence and in your love for us so also make sure that you excel in this act of grace  there is evidence that corrections were made to verse  by later copyists who were referring to other ancient texts most modern translations follow those corrections and they now read and in your love for us  but there are some important and ancient greek copies that read and in our love for you  
i say this not as a command but to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it to the eagerness of other people
for you know the grace of our lord jesus christ even though he was rich for your sakes he became poor so that through his poverty you might become rich 
in this matter i will give you advice that will help you one year ago you not only started to do something but you desired to do it
now finish it just as there was an eagerness and desire to do it then may you also bring it to completion as much as you can
for if you are eager to do this deed it is a good and acceptable thing it must be based on what a person has not on what he does not have 
for this is not to cause relief for others and tribulation for you but for fairness
your abundance at the present time will supply what they need this is also so that their abundance may supply your need and so that there may be fairness
it is as it is written the one with much did not have anything left over  and the one who had little did not have any lack 
but thanks be to god who put into titus heart the same earnest care that i have for you
for he not only accepted our appeal but he was also very earnest about it he came to you of his own free will 
we have sent with him the brother who is praised among all of the churches for his work in proclaiming the gospel
not only this but he also was chosen by the churches to be our traveling companion with this act of grace which is being administered by us for the glory of the lord himself and our good will 
we are avoiding the possibility that anyone should complain about this act of generosity that we are carrying out
we take care to do what is good not only before the lord but also before people 
we are also sending another brother with them we have tested him in many ways and found him diligent for many tasks he is even more eager now because of the great confidence he has in you
as for titus he is my partner and fellow worker for you as for our brothers they are messengers from the churches they are a glory to christ
so show them the proof of your love and show to the churches the reason for our boasting about you  
concerning the service for gods holy people it is not necessary for me to write to you
i know about your desire which i boasted about to the people of macedonia i told them that achaia has been getting ready since last year your eagerness has motivated most of them to action 
now i have sent the brothers so that our boasting about you may not be futile and so that you would be ready as i said you would be
otherwise if any macedonians come with me and find you unprepared we would be ashamedi say nothing about youfor being so confident in you
so i thought it was necessary to urge the brothers to come to you and to make arrangements in advance for the gift you have promised this is so that it might be ready as a blessing and not as something extorted 
the point is this the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and the one who sows for the purpose of a blessing will also reap a blessing
let each one give as he has planned in his heart not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver 
and god is able to make all grace overflow for you so that always in all things you may have all you need this will be so that you may multiply every good deed
it is as it is written he has distributed his riches and given them to the poor  his righteousness lasts forever 
he who supplies seed to the farmer who sows and bread for food will also supply and multiply your seed for sowing he will increase the harvest of your righteousness
you will be enriched in every way so you can be generous this will bring about thanksgiving to god through us 
for carrying out this service not only meets the needs of gods holy people but it also is overflowing into many acts of thanksgiving to god
because of your being tested and proved by this service you will also glorify god by obedience to your confession of the gospel of christ you will also glorify god by the generosity of your contribution to them and to everyone
they long for you and they are praying for you they do this because of the very great grace of god that is on you
may thanks be to god for his inexpressible gift  
i paul myself urge you by the humility and gentleness of christ i am meek when i am in your presence but i am bold toward you when i am away
i beg of you that when i am present with you i will not need to be bold with the confidence that i think i will need to be bold when i oppose those who think that we are walking according to the flesh 
for even though we walk in the flesh we do not make war according to the flesh
for the weapons we fight with are not fleshly rather they have divine power to destroy strongholds they bring misleading arguments to nothing 
we also destroy every high thing that rises up against the knowledge of god we take every thought captive into obedience to christ
and we are getting ready to punish every act of disobedience as soon as your obedience is complete 
look at what is clearly in front of you if anyone is convinced that he is christs let him remind himself that just as he is christs so also are we
for even if i boast a little too much about our authority which the lord gave for us to build you up and not to destroy you i will not be ashamed 
i do not want it to appear that i am terrifying you by my letters
for some people say his letters are serious and powerful but his bodily presence is weak his words are not worth listening to 
let such people be aware that what we are in the words of our letters when we are absent is what we will be in our actions when we are there
we are not so bold as to group ourselves or compare ourselves with those who praise themselves but when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with each other they have no insight 
we however will not boast beyond limits instead we will do so only within the limits of what god has assigned to us limits that reach even as far as you
for we are not overextending ourselves as though we did not reach you we were the first to reach as far as you with the gospel of christ 
we have not boasted beyond limits about the labors of others rather our hope is that as your faith continues to grow our work among you will greatly expand
so that we may preach the gospel even in regions beyond you without boasting of work already done in anothers area 
but let the one who boasts boast in the lord
for it is not the one who recommends himself who is approved but the one whom the lord recommends  
i wish that you could put up with me in some foolishness but you are indeed putting up with me
for i am jealous about you i have a godly jealousy for you since i promised you in marriage to one husband i promised to present you as a pure virgin to christ 
but i am afraid that somehow as the serpent deceived eve by his craftiness your thoughts might be led astray away from a sincere and pure devotion to christ
for suppose that someone comes and proclaims another jesus than the one we preached or suppose that you receive a different spirit than what you received or suppose that you receive a different gospel than the one you received you put up with these things well enough 
for i think that i am not in the least inferior to those socalled superapostles
but even if i am untrained in speech i am not untrained in knowledge in every way and in all things we have made this known to you 
did i sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted for i freely preached the gospel of god to you
i robbed other churches by accepting support from them so that i could serve you
when i was with you and i was in need i did not burden anyone for my needs were met by the brothers who came from macedonia in everything i have kept myself from being a burden to you and i will continue to do that 
as the truth of christ is in me this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the parts of achaia
why because i do not love you god knows 
and what i do i will keep doing so that i may cut off the opportunity of those who want an opportunity to be found to be like us in the things they boast about
for such people are false apostles and deceitful workers they disguise themselves as apostles of christ 
and this is no surprise for even satan disguises himself as an angel of light
it is no great surprise if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness their fate will be what their deeds deserve 
i say again let no one think i am a fool but if you do receive me as a fool so i may boast a little
what i am saying with this boastful confidencei am not talking the way the lord wouldi am saying as a fool
since many people boast according to the flesh i will also boast 
for you gladly put up with fools you are wise yourselves
for you put up with someone if he enslaves you if he devours you if he takes advantage of you if he exalts himself or if he slaps you in the face
i will say to our shame that we were too weak to do that yet if anyone is boldi am speaking like a fooli too will be bold 
are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are they descendants of abraham so am i
are they servants of christ i speak as though i were insane i am more in harder labor in more prisons in beatings beyond measure in facing many deadly dangers 
from jews i received five times the forty lashes minus one
three times i was beaten with rods once i was stoned three times i was shipwrecked i have spent a night and a day on the open sea
i have been on frequent journeys in danger from rivers in danger from robbers in danger from my own people in danger from the gentiles in danger in the city in danger in the wilderness in danger at sea in danger from false brothers 
i have served in labor and toil in many sleepless nights in hunger and thirst often in fasting in cold and nakedness
apart from everything else there is the daily pressure of my concern for all the churches
who is weak and i am not weak who has been caused to stumble and i do not burn 
if i must boast i will boast about what shows my weaknesses
the god and father of the lord jesus the one who is blessed forever knows that i am not lying 
at damascus the governor under king aretas was guarding the city of damascus to arrest me
but i was lowered in a basket through a window in the wall and i escaped from his hands  
i must boast even if it is unprofitable but i will go on to visions and revelations from the lord
i know a man in christ who fourteen years agowhether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knowswas caught up into the third heaven 
and i know that this manwhether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows
was caught up into paradise and heard inexpressible words that people are not permitted to speak
on behalf of such a person i will boast but on behalf of myself i will not boast except about my weaknesses 
if i should choose to boast i will not be a fool because i would be speaking the truth but i will keep from boasting so that no one will think more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me
to keep me from exalting myself because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations a thorn in the flesh was given to me a messenger from satan to afflict meso i would not exalt myself 
three times i pleaded with the lord about this for him to take it away from me
but he said to me my grace is enough for you for power is made perfect in weakness so i would much rather boast about my weakness so that the power of christ might reside on me
therefore i am content for christs sake in weaknesses in insults in troubles in persecutions and distressing situations for whenever i am weak then i am strong 
i have become a fool you forced me to this for i should have been praised by you for i was not at all inferior to the socalled superapostles even though i am nothing
the true signs of an apostle were performed among you with all perseverance signs and wonders and miracles
for how were you less important than the rest of the churches except that i was not a burden to you forgive me for this wrong 
look i am ready to come to you a third time i will not be a burden to you for i do not seek what is yours i want you for children should not save up for the parents instead the parents should save up for the children
i will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls if i love you more am i to be loved less 
but as it is i did not burden you but since i am so crafty i am the one who caught you by deceit
did i take advantage of you by anyone i sent to you
i urged titus to go to you and i sent the other brother with him did titus take advantage of you did we not walk in the same spirit did we not walk in the same steps 
do you think all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you it is in the sight of god that we speak in christ and all for your strengthening beloved 
for i fear that when i come i may not find you as i wish i fear that you might not find me as you wish i fear that there may be quarreling jealousy outbursts of anger rivalries slander gossip arrogance and disorder
i fear that when i come back my god might humble me before you i fear that i might be grieved by many of those who have sinned before now and who did not repent of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustful indulgence that they practiced  
this is the third time that i am coming to you every matter must be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses
i have already said to those who sinned before and to all the rest when i was there the second time and i say it again when i come again i will not spare them 
i tell you this because you are looking for proof that christ is speaking through me he is not weak toward you rather he is powerful in you
for he was crucified in weakness but he is alive by gods power for we also are weak in him but we will live with him by the power of god among you 
examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith test yourselves do you not realize this about yourselves that jesus christ is in youunless of course you have failed the test
and i hope that you will recognize that we have not failed the test 
now we pray to god that you may not do any wrong i do not pray this so that we may appear to have passed the test rather i pray that you may do what is proper although we may seem to have failed the test
for we are not able to do anything against the truth but only for the truth 
for we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong we also pray that you may be made complete
i write these things while i am away from you so that when i am with you i do not have to deal harshly with you in the use of my authoritywhich the lord gave to me so that i may build you up and not tear you down 
finally brothers rejoice work for restoration be encouraged think alike live in peace and the god of love and peace will be with you
greet each other with a holy kiss all gods holy people greet you  some copies number this sentence as verse  
the grace of the lord jesus christ, the love of god, and the fellowship of the holy spirit be with all of you.  some translations number this sentence as verse .
paul an apostlenot an apostle from men nor by human agency but through jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead
and all the brothers with me to the churches of galatia 
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
who gave himself for our sins so that he might deliver us from this present evil age according to the will of our god and father
to him be the glory forever and ever amen 
i am amazed that you are turning away so quickly from him who called you by the grace of christ i am amazed that you are turning to a different gospel
not that there is another gospel but there are some men who cause you trouble and want to distort the gospel of christ 
but even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you let him be cursed
as we have said before so now i say again if someone proclaims to you a gospel other than the one you received let him be cursed
for am i now seeking the favor of men or of god am i seeking to please men if i am still trying to please men i am not a servant of christ 
for i want you to know brothers that the gospel i proclaimed is not mans gospel
i did not receive it from any man nor was i taught it instead it was by revelation of jesus christ to me 
you have heard about my former life in judaism how i was persecuting the church of god beyond measure and that i was trying to destroy it
i advanced in judaism beyond many of those who were my own age from out of my own people that is how extremely zealous i was for the traditions of my fathers 
but when god who had set me apart from my mothers womb and who called me through his grace was pleased
to reveal his son in me so that i might preach him among the gentiles i did not immediately consult with flesh and blood
i did not go up to jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me instead i went to arabia and then returned to damascus 
then after three years i went up to jerusalem to get to know cephas and i stayed with him fifteen days
but i saw none of the other apostles except james the lords brother
in what i write to you i assure you before god that i am not lying 
then i went to the regions of syria and cilicia
i was still not known by face to the churches of judea that are in christ
they only heard it being said the man who once persecuted us is now proclaiming as good news the faith he once tried to destroy
so they glorified god because of me  
then after fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas taking titus along with me
i went up because of a revelation and set before them the gospel that i preach among the gentiles i spoke privately to those who seemed to be important in order to make sure that i was not runningor had not runin vain 
but not even titus who was with me and who was a greek was forced to be circumcised
the false brothers came in secretly to spy on the liberty we have in christ jesus they desired to enslave us
but we did not yield in submission to them for a moment so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you 
but those who seemed to be important whatever they were does not matter to me god shows no partialitythose i say who seemed important added nothing to me
on the contrary they saw that i had been entrusted with the gospel to those who are uncircumcised just as peter had been entrusted with the gospel to those who are circumcised
for god who worked in peter for the apostleship to those who are circumcised also worked in me to the gentiles 
when james cephas and john who had a reputation as pillars recognized the grace that had been given to me they gave the right hand of fellowship to barnabas and me they agreed that we should go to the gentiles and they should go to the circumcised
they requested only that we remember the poor the very thing that i was eager to do 
but when cephas came to antioch i opposed him to his face because he stood condemned
before certain men came from james cephas was eating with the gentiles but when these men came he stopped and kept away from the gentiles he was afraid of those who were demanding circumcision 
also the rest of the jews joined in this hypocrisy even barnabas was led astray with them by their hypocrisy
but when i saw that their behavior was not following the truth of the gospel i said to cephas in front of all of them if you are a jew but are living like a gentile and not like a jew how can you force the gentiles to live like jews 
we ourselves are jews by birth and not gentile sinners
yet we know that no person is justified by the works of the law but through faith in christ jesus so we also have believed in christ jesus so that we might be justified by faith in christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law no flesh will be justified 
but if while we seek to be justified in christ we too were found to be sinners is christ then a minister of sin absolutely not
for if i rebuild those things i once destroyed i prove myself to be a transgressor
for through the law i died to the law so that i might live for god i have been crucified with christ  some translations include this sentence with verse  
it is no longer i who live but christ lives in me the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
i do not set aside the grace of god for if righteousness could be gained through the law then christ died for nothing  
foolish galatians who has put a spell on you it was before your eyes that jesus christ was publicly displayed as crucified
this is the only thing i want to learn from you did you receive the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith
are you so foolish having begun by the spirit are you now going to be perfected by the flesh 
have you suffered so many things for nothingif indeed it was for nothing
does he who gives the spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith 
just as abraham believed god and it was credited to him as righteousness
in the same way understand then that those of faith are the children of abraham
the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the gentiles by faith preached the gospel beforehand to abraham saying in you all the nations will be blessed
so then those of faith are blessed along with abraham the man of faith 
all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse and so it is written cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things written in the book of the law and do them
now it is clear that no one is justified before god by the law because the righteous will live by faith
but the law is not of faith rather the person who does the works of the law must live by them 
christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for usfor it is written cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree
so that the blessing of abraham might come to the gentiles in christ jesus so that by faith we might receive the promise of the spirit 
brothers let me speak in human terms once a manmade contract is established by law no one can set it aside or add to it
now the promises were spoken to abraham and to his descendant it does not say to descendants referring to many but instead to only one and to your descendant who is christ 
now what i am saying is this the law which came  years afterward does not set aside the covenant previously established by god to nullify the promise
for if the inheritance comes by the law then it no longer comes by promise but god freely gave it to abraham by a promise 
what then was the purpose of the law it was added because of transgressions until the descendant of abraham would come to whom the promise had been made the law was ordained through angels by the hand of an intermediary
now an intermediary implies more than one person but god is one 
so is the law against the promises of god absolutely not for if a law had been given that could give life then righteousness would certainly have come by the law
but the scripture imprisoned everything under sin so that the promise by faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe 
now before faith came we were held captive under the law imprisoned until faith should be revealed
so then the law became our guardian until christ came so that we might be justified by faith
but now that faith has come we are no longer under a guardian
for you are all sons of god through faith in christ jesus 
for as many of you who were baptized into christ have clothed yourselves with christ
there is neither jew nor greek there is neither slave nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus
then if you are christs you are abrahams descendants and heirs according to promise  
i am saying that the heir for whatever time he is a child is no different from a slave though he is owner of the entire estate
but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father 
so also when we were children we were enslaved to the elemental principles of the world
but when the fullness of time had come god sent out his son born of a woman born under the law
so that he might redeem those under the law so that we might receive adoption as sons 
and because you are sons god has sent the spirit of his son into our hearts who cries out abba father
so you are no longer a slave but a son and if a son then you are also an heir through god 
but at that time when you did not know god you were made to be slaves to those who are by their natural powers not gods at all
but now that you have come to know god or rather that you are known by god how is it that you are turning back to the weak and worthless elemental principles do you want to be enslaved all over again 
you observe days and new moons and seasons and years
i am afraid for you that somehow my labor with you may have been for nothing 
i beg you brothers become like me for i also have become like you you did me no wrong
but you know that it was because of a disease of the flesh that i proclaimed the gospel to you the first time
and though my physical condition put you to the test you did not despise or reject me instead you welcomed me as if i were an angel of god as if i were christ jesus himself 
where then is your blessing now for i testify to you that if it were possible you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me
so then have i become your enemy because i am telling you the truth 
they are zealous to win you over but for no good purpose they want to shut you out so you may be zealous for them
it is always good to be zealous for a good purpose and not only when i am present with you 
my little children again i am suffering the pains of childbirth for you until christ is formed in you
i wish i could be present with you now and change my tone because i am perplexed about you 
tell me you who desire to be under the law do you not listen to the law
for it is written that abraham had two sons one by the slave girl and one by the free woman
one was born by the slave girl according to the flesh but the other was born by the free woman through promise 
these things may be interpreted as an allegory for these women represent two covenants one of them is from mount sinai and she bears children into slavery this is hagar
now hagar represents mount sinai in arabia and she represents the present jerusalem for she is in slavery with her children 
but the jerusalem that is above is free and she is our mother
for it is written  rejoice you barren one who does not give birth  cry out and shout for joy  you who are not suffering the pains of childbirth  because the children of the desolate woman are more numerous  than those of the woman who has a husband 
but you brothers like isaac are children of promise
at that time the one who was born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the spirit it is the same now 
but what does the scripture say send away the slave girl and her son for the son of the slave girl will not share in the inheritance with the son of the free woman
therefore brothers we are not children of a slave girl but of the free woman  
for freedom christ has set us free stand firm therefore and do not again be subject to a yoke of slavery
look i paul say to you that if you let yourselves be circumcised christ will not benefit you in any way 
i testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law
you are cut off from christ you who would be justified by the law you no longer experience grace 
for through the spirit by faith we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness
in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has value but only faith working through love
you were running well who prevented you from obeying the truth
this persuasion does not come from him who calls you 
a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough
i have confidence in the lord that you will think nothing different the one who is troubling you will suffer the judgment whoever he is 
brothers if i still proclaim circumcision why am i still being persecuted in that case the stumbling block of the cross has been removed
as for those who are disturbing you i wish they would cut themselves off 
for you were called to freedom brothers but do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh rather through love serve one another
for the whole law is fulfilled in one word you must love your neighbor as yourself
but if you bite and devour one another watch out that you are not consumed by one another 
but i say walk by the spirit and you will not carry out the desires of the flesh
for the desires of the flesh are against the spirit and the desires of the spirit are against the flesh for these oppose each other so that you cannot do the things you want
but if you are led by the spirit you are not under the law 
now the works of the flesh are evident sexual immorality impurity sensuality
idolatry sorcery hostilities strife jealousy outbursts of anger rivalry dissension divisions
envy drunkenness drunken celebrations and things like these i warn you as i warned you before that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of god 
but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faith
gentleness and selfcontrol against such things there is no law
those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires 
if we live by the spirit let us also walk by the spirit
let us not become boastful provoking one another envying one another  
brothers if someone is caught in any trespass you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness be concerned about yourself so you also may not be tempted
carry one anothers burdens and so fulfill the law of christ 
for if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing he deceives himself
each one should examine his own work and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in someone else
for each one will carry his own burden 
the one who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches
do not be deceived god is not mocked for whatever a man plants that he will also reap
for he who plants seed to his own flesh from the flesh will reap destruction the one who plants seed to the spirit from the spirit will reap eternal life 
let us not become weary in doing good for at the right time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up
so then as we have the opportunity let us do good to all people especially to those who belong to the household of faith 
see what large letters i write to you with my own hand
those who want to make a good impression in the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised they do this only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of christ
for not even those who circumcised themselves keep the law but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh 
but may i never boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ through which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world
for neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision but what counts is a new creation
to all who walk according to this standard peace and mercy be upon them even upon the israel of god 
from now on let no one trouble me for i carry on my body the marks of jesus
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit, brothers. amen.
paul an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god to gods holy people in ephesus who are faithful in christ jesus  some important and ancient greek copies do not have in ephesus but this letter may have been circulated throughout this region to several churches not just to the church in ephesus
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ 
may the god and father of our lord jesus christ be praised who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in christ
god chose us in him from the foundation of the world that we may be holy and blameless in his sight in love 
god predestined us  some interpreters place the last phrase of ephesians  in love  with verse  so that it reads in love god predestined us  for adoption as sons through jesus christ according to the good pleasure of his will
our adoption results in the praise of his glorious grace that he has freely given us in the one he loves 
in jesus christ we have redemption through his blood and the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace
he multiplied this grace to us with all wisdom and understanding 
god made known to us the mystery of his will according to what pleased him and which he demonstrated in christ
with a view to a plan for the fullness of time to bring all things togetherall things in heaven and on earthunder one head even christ 
in christ we were given an inheritance having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything according to the purpose of his will
god appointed us as heirs so that we who are the first to hope in christ would be for the praise of his glory 
in christ you alsowhen you had heard the word of truththe gospel of your salvation believed in him and were sealed with the promised holy spirit
who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the possession to the praise of his glory 
for this reason ever since i heard about your faith in the lord jesus and your love for all gods holy people
i have not stopped thanking god for you as i mention you in my prayers 
i pray that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory will give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him
i pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened that you may know the hope to which he has called you and the riches of his glorious inheritance among all gods holy people 
in my prayers i ask that you may know the incomparable greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the working of the strength of his might
this is the same power that he worked in christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places
he seated christ far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named christ will rule not only in this age but also in the age to come 
god subjected all things under christs feet and gave him to the church as head over all things
the church is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all  
and as for you you were dead in your trespasses and sins
in which you once walked according to the ways of this world you were living according to the ruler of the authorities of the air the spirit that is working in the sons of disobedience
once we all lived among these people fulfilling the evil desires of our flesh and carrying out the desires of the flesh and of the mind we were by nature children of wrath like the rest of humanity 
but god is rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us
while we were dead in trespasses he made us alive together in christby grace you have been saved
god raised us up together with christ and god made us sit together in the heavenly places in christ jesus
so that in the ages to come he might show to us the immeasurably great riches of his grace expressed in his kindness toward us in christ jesus 
for by grace you have been saved through faith and this did not come from you it is the gift of god
not from works so that no one may boast
for we are gods workmanship created in christ jesus to do good deeds that god planned long ago for us so that we would walk in them 
therefore remember that once you were gentiles in the flesh you are called uncircumcision by what is called the circumcision in the flesh made by human hands
for at that time you were separated from christ foreigners to citizenship in israel strangers to the covenants of the promise having no hope and without god in the world 
but now in christ jesus you who once were far away from god have been brought near by the blood of christ
for he himself is our peace because he made us both one by his flesh he broke down the dividing wall of hostility
he set aside the law with its commands and ordinances so that he might create in himself one new man out of two so making peace
christ reconciles both peoples into one body to god through the cross putting to death the hostility 
jesus came and proclaimed the good news of peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near
for through jesus we both have access in one spirit to the father 
so then now you gentiles are no longer foreigners and strangers rather you are fellow citizens with gods holy people and members of the household of god
you have been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets and christ jesus himself is the cornerstone
in him the whole building fits together and grows as a holy temple in the lord
it is in him that you also are being built together as a dwelling place for god in the spirit  
for this reason i paul the prisoner of christ jesus for you gentiles
i assume that you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of god that was given to me for you 
the mystery was made known to me by revelation as i have written briefly
when you read about this you will be able to understand my insight into this mystery about christ
in other generations this mystery was not made known to the sons of men but now it has been revealed by the spirit to his holy apostles and prophets 
this hidden truth is that the gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body and they share the promise in christ jesus through the gospel
for i became a servant of this gospel by the gift of gods grace given to me through the working of his power 
to mealthough i am the least of all gods holy peoplethis grace was given to preach to the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ
and to bring to light for everyone the planthe mystery hidden for ages in god who created all things 
this plan was made known through the church so the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places would come to know the manysided nature of the wisdom of god
this happened according to the eternal plan that he accomplished in christ jesus our lord 
for in christ we have boldness and access with confidence because of our faith in him
therefore i ask you not to be discouraged because of my tribulations for you which is your glory 
for this reason i bend my knees to the father
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named
i pray that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his spirit who is in your inner person 
i pray that christ may live in your hearts through faith and that you may be rooted and founded in his love
in order that you might be able to understand along with all gods holy people what is the width the length the height and the depth
and to know the love of christ which goes beyond knowledge so that you may be filled with all the fullness of god 
now to him who is able to do far beyond all that we ask or think according to his power that works in us
to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus to all generations forever and ever amen  
i therefore as the prisoner for the lord urge you to walk worthily of the calling by which you were called
i urge you to live with great humility and gentleness and patience bearing with one another in love
do your best to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace 
there is one body and one spirit just as also you were called in one hope of your calling
and there is one lord one faith one baptism
and one god and father of all who is over all and through all and in all 
to each one of us grace has been given according to the measure of the gift of christ
it is as scripture says when he ascended on high he led the captives into captivity and he gave gifts to the people 
what is the meaning of he ascended except that he also descended into the lower regions of the earth
he who descended is the same person who also ascended far above all the heavens that he might fill all things 
christ gave some to be apostles some as prophets some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers
to equip gods holy people for the work of service for the building up of the body of christ
until we all reach the unity of faith and knowledge of the son of god so that we become mature and reach the measure of the fullness of christ 
christ builds us up so that we should no longer be children who are tossed back and forth by the waves carried away by every wind of doctrine and by the trickery of people in their deceitful schemes
instead speaking the truth in love we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head that is christ
christ builds the whole body and it is joined and held together by every supporting ligament and when each part works together that makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love 
therefore i say and insist on this in the lord that you must no longer walk as the gentiles walk in the futility of their minds
they are darkened in their understanding alienated from the life of god because of the ignorance that is in them because of the hardness of their hearts
they have become shameless and have committed themselves to sensuality and they practice every kind of uncleanness with greed 
but that is not how you learned about christ
i assume that you have heard about him and that you were taught in him as the truth is in jesus
you were taught to put off what belongs to your former manner of life to put off the old man it is the old man that is corrupt because of its deceitful desires 
you were taught to be renewed in the spirit of your minds
and to put on the new man that is created in the image of godin true righteousness and holiness 
therefore get rid of lies and let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor because we are members of one another
be angry and do not sin do not let the sun go down on your anger
do not give an opportunity to the devil 
the one who had been stealing must steal no longer instead he must labor working at what is good with his hands so that he may have something to share with those who are in need
do not let any harmful talk come out of your mouth use only words that are good for the edification of those who need it so that your words give grace to the hearers
and do not grieve the holy spirit of god for it is by him that you were sealed for the day of redemption 
put away all bitterness rage anger quarreling and insults along with every kind of evil
be kind to each other tenderhearted forgiving one another just as god in christ forgave you  
therefore be imitators of god as beloved children
and walk in love as also christ loved us and gave himself up for us a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god 
but sexual immorality or any kind of uncleanness or of greed must not even be named among you for these are improper for gods holy people
let there be no filthiness no foolish talk and no crude jokesall of which are improper instead there should be thanksgiving 
for you know and are certain that no sexually immoral impure or greedy personthat is an idolaterhas any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and god
let no one deceive you with empty words for because of these things the wrath of god is coming upon the sons of disobedience
therefore do not join in with them 
for you were once darkness but now you are light in the lord walk as children of light
for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness righteousness and truth
and test and approve what is pleasing to the lord
do not associate with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather expose them
for it is disgraceful even to mention the things they do in secret 
but when anything is exposed by the light it becomes visible
for anything that becomes visible is light therefore it says awake you sleeper and arise from the dead and christ will shine on you 
look carefully how you walknot as unwise but as wise
redeem the time because the days are evil
therefore do not be foolish but understand what the will of the lord is 
and do not get drunk with wine for that leads to reckless behavior instead be filled with the holy spirit
speaking to each other in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody to the lord with all your heart
always giving thanks for everything in the name of our lord jesus christ to god the father
being subject to one another in reverence for christ 
wives submit to your husbands as to the lord
for the husband is the head of the wife as christ also is the head of the church himself the savior of the body
but as the church is subject to christ so also wives to their husbands in everything 
husbands love your wives as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
so that he might sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word
so that he might present the church to himself as glorious without stain or wrinkle or any such thing but holy and blameless 
in the same way husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies he who loves his own wife loves himself
for no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and treats it with care just as christ nourishes and treats the church with care
because we are members of his body 
for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh
this hidden truth is greatbut i am speaking about christ and the church
nevertheless each of you also must love his own wife as himself and the wife must respect her husband  
children obey your parents in the lord for this is proper
honor your father and mother which is the first commandment with promise
so that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth 
fathers do not provoke your children to anger instead raise them in the discipline and instruction of the lord 
slaves be obedient to your masters according to the flesh with deep respect and trembling in the honesty of your heart be obedient to them as you would be obedient to christ
be obedient not only when your masters are watching in order to please them instead be obedient as slaves of christ who do the will of god from your heart
serve with all your heart as though you were serving the lord and not people
because we know that for whatever good deed each person does he will receive a reward from the lord whether he is slave or free 
masters treat your slaves in the same way do not threaten them you know that he who is both their master and yours is in heaven and there is no partiality with him 
finally be strong in the lord and in the strength of his might
put on the whole armor of god so that you may be able to stand against the scheming plans of the devil 
for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers over this present darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places
therefore put on the whole armor of god so that you may be able to stand in the evil day and after you have done everything to stand firm 
stand firm then with the belt of truth buckled around your waist and having put on the breastplate of righteousness
and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace
in all circumstances take up the shield of faith by which you will be able to put out all the flaming arrows of the evil one 
and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god
with every prayer and request pray at all times in the spirit to this end always be watching with all perseverance as you offer prayers for all gods holy people 
and pray for me that a message might be given to me when i open my mouth pray that i might make known with boldness the hidden truth about the gospel
it is for the gospel that i am an ambassador who is kept in chains so that i may declare it boldly as i ought to speak 
tychicus the beloved brother and faithful servant in the lord will make everything known to you so that you may know how i am doing
i have sent him to you for this very purpose so that you may know how we are and so that he may encourage your hearts 
peace be to the brothers and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ
grace be to all those who love our lord jesus christ with an incorruptible love.
paul and timothy servants of christ jesus to all gods holy people in christ jesus who are at philippi with the overseers and deacons
may grace be to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ 
i thank my god every time i remember you
always in every prayer of mine for all of you making my prayer with joy
because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now
i am confident of this very thing that he who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of christ jesus 
it is proper for me to feel this way about all of you because i have you in my heart you all have been my partners in grace both in my imprisonment and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel
for god is my witness how i long for all of you with the compassion of christ jesus 
so this is my prayer that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all understanding
so that you may approve what is excellent and so you may be sincere and blameless until the day of christ
filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through jesus christ to the glory and praise of god 
now i want you to know brothers that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel
as a result my chains in christ came to light throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else
most of the brothers have far more confidence in the lord because of my chains and they have courage to fearlessly speak the word 
some indeed even proclaim christ out of envy and strife and also others out of good will
the latter do it out of love knowing that i am put here for the defense of the gospel
but the former proclaim christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely they think they will cause me distress while i am in chains 
what then only that in every waywhether from false motives or from truechrist is proclaimed and in this i rejoice yes and i will rejoice
for i know that this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the spirit of jesus christ 
it is my eager expectation and hope that i will in no way be ashamed but with all boldness now as always christ will be exalted in my body whether by life or by death
for to me to live is christ and to die is gain 
but if i am to live in the flesh that means fruitful labor for me yet which to choose i do not know
for i am hard pressed between the two my desire is to depart and be with christ which is far better
yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake 
being convinced of this i know that i will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith
so that in me you may have increasing reasons to boast in christ jesus when i come to you again
only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of christ so that whether i come to see you or am absent i may hear about you that you are standing firm in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel 
do not be frightened in any respect by those who are your opponents this is a sign to them of their destruction but of your salvationand this from god
for it has been freely given to you for the sake of christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake
having the same conflict which you saw in me and now you hear in me  
if there is any encouragement in christ if there is any comfort provided by love if there is any fellowship in the spirit if there are any tender mercies and compassions
then make my joy full by being of the same mind having the same love being united in spirit and having one purpose 
do nothing out of ambition or empty conceit instead with humility consider others better than yourselves
let each of you look out not only for his own interests but also for the interests of others 
have this mind in yourselves which also was in christ jesus
who though he existed in the form of god  did not consider his equality with god as something to hold on to
rather he emptied himself  taking the form of a servant  and he was born in the likeness of men and being found in the form of a man 
he humbled himself  and became obedient to the point of death  even death on a cross 
therefore also god highly exalted him  and gave him the name that is above every name
so that at the name of jesus every knee should bow  in heaven and on earth and under the earth
and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord  to the glory of god the father 
so then my beloved as you always obey not only in my presence but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling
for it is god who is working in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure 
do all things without complaining or arguing
so that you may become blameless and pure children of god without blemish in the middle of a crooked and depraved generation in which you shine as lights in the world
hold on to the word of life so that on the day of christ i may boast that i did not run in vain or labor in vain 
but even if i am being poured out as an offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith i am glad and rejoice with you all
in the same manner you also should be glad and rejoice with me 
but i hope in the lord jesus to send timothy to you soon so that i may also be encouraged when i know the things about you
for i have no one else like him who is truly concerned for you
for they all seek their own interests not the things of jesus christ 
but you know his proven worth because as a son with his father so he served with me in the gospel
so i hope to send him as soon as i see how things will go with me
but i am confident in the lord that i myself will also come soon 
but i think it is necessary to send epaphroditus back to you he is my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier and your messenger and servant for my needs
for he was very distressed and he longed to be with you all because you heard that he was sick
for indeed he was so sick that he almost died but god had mercy on him and not on him only but also on me so that i might not have sorrow upon sorrow 
so it is all the more eagerly that i am sending him so that when you see him again you may rejoice and i can have less sorrow
therefore welcome him in the lord with all joy honor people like him
for it was for the work of christ that he came near death he risked his life so that he could bring to completion what was lacking in your service to me  
finally my brothers rejoice in the lord for me to write these same things again to you is no trouble for me and it keeps you safe
watch out for the dogs watch out for those evil workers watch out for the mutilation
for it is we who are the circumcisionthe ones who worship by the spirit of god and take pride in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh 
even so i myself could have confidence in the flesh if anyone thinks he has confidence in the flesh i could have even more
i was circumcised on the eighth day of the people of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of hebrews with regard to the law a pharisee 
as for zeal i persecuted the church as for righteousness under the law i was blameless
but whatever things were a profit for me i have considered them as loss because of christ 
in fact now i count all things to be loss because of the surpassing value of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for him i have given up all thingsand i consider them rubbishso that i may gain christ
and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own from the law but that which is through faith in christthe righteousness from god that is by faith
so now i want to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings becoming like him in his death
so somehow i may experience the resurrection from the dead 
not that i have already obtained these things or am already perfect but i press on to take hold of that for which i was taken hold of by christ jesus
brothers i do not think that i myself have yet taken hold of it but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and straining forward to what is ahead
i press on toward the goal with a view to the prize of the upward call of god in christ jesus 
all of us who are mature let us think this way and if you think differently about anything god will also reveal that to you
nevertheless let us live up to what we have already attained 
be imitators of me brothers closely watch those who are walking by the example that you have in us
many are walkingthose about whom i have often told you and now i am telling you with tearsas enemies of the cross of christ
their end is destruction for their god is their stomach and their glory is in their shame they think about earthly things 
but our citizenship is in heaven from where we also wait for a savior the lord jesus christ
he will transform our lowly bodies into bodies formed like his glorious body formed by the might of his power to subject all things to himself  
therefore my beloved brothers whom i long for my joy and crown in this way stand firm in the lord beloved friends
i am pleading with euodia and i am pleading with syntyche be of the same mind in the lord
yes i ask you my true companion to help these women who labored with me in spreading the gospel along with clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life 
rejoice in the lord always again i will say rejoice
let your gentleness be known to all people the lord is near
do not be anxious about anything instead in everything by prayer and earnest appeal with thanksgiving let your requests be known to god
and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your thoughts in christ jesus 
finally brothers whatever things are true whatever things are honorable whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there is anything excellent if there is anything to be praised think about these things
the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me do these things and the god of peace will be with you 
i greatly rejoice in the lord because now at last you have renewed your concern for me you had indeed been concerned for me before but there was no opportunity for you to help
i am not saying this because i am in need for i have learned to be content in all circumstances
i know what it is to be poor and i also know what it is to have plenty in every way and in all things i have learned the secret of how to be well fed or to be hungry and how to have an abundance or to be in need
i can do all things through him who strengthens me 
however you did well to share with me in my difficulties
you philippians know that in the beginning of the gospel when i left macedonia no church supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone
even when i was in thessalonica you sent help for my needs more than once
it is not that i seek the gift instead i seek the fruit that increases to your credit 
i have received everything in full and even more i have been well supplied now that i have received from epaphroditus the things you sent they are a sweetsmelling aroma a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to god
my god will meet all your needs according to his riches in glory in christ jesus
now to our god and father be the glory forever and ever amen 
greet all gods holy people in christ jesus the brothers who are with me greet you
all gods holy people who are here greet you especially those of caesars household
the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit.  some ancient and important greek copies add amen , and there are some ancient greek copies that have that word at the end of every new testament book. there are also many important and ancient greek copies that do not have the final amen .
paul an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god and timothy our brother
to gods holy people and faithful brothers in christ who are at colossae may grace be to you and peace from god our father  some important and ancient greek copies add and the lord jesus christ 
we give thanks to god the father of our lord jesus christ and we always pray for you 
we have heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love that you have for all gods holy people
because of the hope reserved for you in heaven which you heard about in the word of truth the gospel
which has come to you in the same way this gospel is bearing fruit and is growing in all the worldjust as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood the grace of god in truth 
this is the gospel as you learned it from epaphras our beloved fellow servant who is a faithful servant of christ on our behalf  some important and ancient greek copies read on your behalf 
epaphras has made known to us your love in the spirit 
because of this love from the day we heard this we have not stopped praying for you we pray that you will be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding
so that you will walk in a manner that is worthy of the lord and that pleases him in every way by bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of god 
by being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience and by joyfully
giving thanks to the father who made you able  some ancient greek copies read who made us able  to have a share in the inheritance of gods holy people in light 
he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son
in whom we have redemption the forgiveness of sins  some ancient greek copies read in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins  it may be a reference to ephesians  
he is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation
for in him all things were created those in the heavens and those on the earth the visible and the invisible things whether thrones or dominions or governments or authorities all things were created through him and for him
he himself is before all things and in him all things hold together 
he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning the firstborn from among the dead so he has first place among all things
for god was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in the son
and through the son to reconcile all things to himself having made peace through the blood of his cross whether things on earth or things in heaven 
at one time you also were alienated and hostile in mind and in evil deeds
but now he has reconciled you by his physical body through death to present you holy blameless and above accusation before him
if indeed you continue in the faith established and firm not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you heard which was proclaimed to every person created under heaven this is the gospel of which i paul became a servant 
now i rejoice in my sufferings for you and i fill up in my flesh what is lacking of the afflictions of christ for the sake of his body which is the church
it is of this church that i am a servant according to the stewardship from god that was given to me for you to fulfill the word of god
this is the mystery that was hidden for ages and for generations but now has been revealed to gods holy people
it is to them that god wanted to make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory 
we proclaim him warning every person and teaching every person with all wisdom so that we may present every person mature in christ
for this i labor and strive according to his energy that is at work in me in power  
for i want you to know how great a struggle i have had for you for those at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh
i work so that their hearts may be encouraged by being brought together in love and into all the riches of full assurance of understanding into the knowledge of the mystery of god that is christ
in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden 
i say this so that no one may trick you with persuasive speech
although i am not with you in the flesh yet i am with you in spirit i rejoice to see your good order and the strength of your faith in christ 
as you received christ jesus the lord walk in him
be rooted in him be built on him be established in faith just as you were taught and abound in thanksgiving 
see that no one captures you through philosophy and empty deceit according to the tradition of men conforming to the elemental spirits of the world and not conforming to christ
for in him all the fullness of god lives in bodily form 
you have been filled in him who is the head over every ruler and authority
in him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not done by humans in the removal of the body of flesh but in the circumcision of christ
you were buried with him in baptism and in him you were raised up through faith in the power of god who raised him from the dead 
when you were dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh he made you alive together with him and forgave us all of our trespasses  some ancient greek copies read and forgave you all of your trespasses 
he blotted out the written record of debts that was hostile to us with its regulations he took it away by nailing it to the cross
he disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public spectacle of them triumphing over them by the cross 
so then let no one judge you in eating or in drinking or about a festival or a new moon or about sabbath days
these are a shadow of the things to come but the substance is christ 
let no one who wants humility and the worship of angels judge you out of your prize such a person enters into the things he has seen and becomes puffed up for no reason by his fleshly thinking
he does not hold on to the head it is from the head that the whole body throughout its joints and ligaments is supplied and held together it grows with the growth given by god 
if you died together with christ to the elemental spirits of the world why do you live as obligated to the world
do not handle nor taste nor touch
all these things will perish with use according to the commandments and teachings of men
these rules have the appearance of wisdom with their selfmade religion and humility and severe treatment of the body but they have no value against the indulgence of the flesh  
if then god has raised you with christ seek the things above where christ is sitting at the right hand of god
think about the things above not about the things on earth
for you have died and your life is hidden with christ in god
when christ appears who is your life then you will also appear with him in glory  some ancient greek copies and some ancient translations read when christ appears who is our life then you will also appear with him in glory  
put to death then the members that are on earthsexual immorality uncleanness passion evil desire and greed which is idolatry
it is for these things that the wrath of god is coming on the sons of disobedience  some ancient greek copies read it is for these things that the wrath of god is coming 
it is in these things that you also once walked when you lived in them
but now you must get rid of all these thingswrath anger evil intentions slander and obscene speech from your mouth 
do not lie to one another since you have taken off the old man with its practices
and you have put on the new man that is being made new in knowledge according to the image of the one who created it
where there is no greek or jew circumcision or uncircumcision barbarian scythian slave freeman but christ is all and is in all 
therefore as gods chosen ones holy and beloved put on a heart of mercy kindness humility gentleness and patience
bear with one another be gracious to each other if someone has a complaint against someone else forgive in the same way that the lord has forgiven you
above all these things have love which is the bond of perfection 
let the peace of christ rule in your hearts it was for this peace that you were called in one body and be thankful
let the word of christ live in you richly teaching and instructing one another with all wisdom singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to god
whatever you do in word or in deed do all in the name of the lord jesus give thanks to god the father through him 
wives submit to your husbands as it is appropriate in the lord
husbands love your wives and do not be bitter against them
children obey your parents in all things for this is pleasing in the lord
fathers do not provoke your children so that they will not be discouraged 
slaves obey your masters according to the flesh in all things not with eyeservice as peoplepleasers but with a sincere heart fear the lord
whatever you do work from the soul as to the lord and not as to people
you know that you will receive from the lord the reward of the inheritance it is the lord christ whom you serve
for anyone who does unrighteousness will receive the penalty for the unrighteousness that he did and there is no partiality  
masters give to slaves what is right and fair knowing you also have a master in heaven 
continue steadfastly in prayer staying alert in it in thanksgiving
praying together for us also that god would open a door to us for the word to speak the mystery of christ for which also i have been in chains
pray that i may make it clear as i ought to speak 
walk in wisdom toward those outside and redeem the time
let your words always be with grace let them be seasoned with salt so that you may know how you should answer each person 
as for all the things concerning me tychicus will make them known to you he is a beloved brother faithful servant and fellow slave in the lord
i have sent him to you for this that you might know the matters about us and so that he may encourage your hearts  there are some important and ancient greek copies along with some ancient translations of the greek that read i sent him to you for this that he might know the matters about you and that he may encourage your hearts 
i have sent him together with onesimus the faithful and beloved brother who is one of you they will make known to you everything that has happened here 
aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you as well as mark the cousin of barnabas about whom you received orders if he comes to you receive him
and also jesus who is called justus these alone of the circumcision are my fellow workers for the kingdom of god they have been a comfort to me 
epaphras greets you he is one of you and a slave of christ jesus he always strives for you in prayer so that you may stand complete and fully assured in all the will of god
for i can testify that he works hard for you for those in laodicea and for those in hierapolis
luke the beloved physician and demas greet you 
greet the brothers in laodicea and nympha and the church that is in her house
when this letter has been read among you have it read also in the church of the laodiceans and see that you also read the letter from laodicea
say to archippus look to the ministry that you have received in the lord that you should fulfill it 
this greeting is with my own handpaul. remember my chains. may grace be with you.
paul silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ may grace and peace be to you  some important and ancient greek copies read may grace and peace be to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ  
we always give thanks to god for all of you as we mention you continually in our prayers
we remember before our god and father your work of faith labor of love and patient endurance of hope in our lord jesus christ 
brothers loved by god we know he has chosen you
because our gospel came to you not in word only but also in power in the holy spirit and in much assurance in the same way you also know what kind of men we were among you for your sake 
you became imitators of us and of the lord when you received the word in much tribulation with joy from the holy spirit
as a result you became an example to all in macedonia and achaia who believe 
for from you the word of the lord has rung out and not only in macedonia and achaia but your faith in god has gone out everywhere therefore we do not need to say anything about it
for they themselves report concerning us what kind of reception we had among you and how you turned to god from the idols to serve the living and true god
and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the deadjesus who rescues us from the wrath to come  
for you yourselves know brothers that our coming to you was not useless
rather as you know though we previously suffered and were shamefully treated at philippi we were bold in our god to speak to you the gospel of god in much struggling 
for our exhortation was not from error nor from uncleanness nor from deceit
instead just as we have been approved by god to be trusted with the gospel so we speak not to please men but god he is the one who examines our hearts 
for we never came with words of flattery as you know nor with a pretext to cover up greedgod is our witness
nor did we seek glory from people either from you or from others 
we could have claimed privileges as apostles of christ  many copies include this sentence in verse  instead we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children  some important and ancient greek copies read instead we were like babies among you as when a mother comforts her own children 
in this way we had affection for you we were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of god but also our own lives for you had become very dear to us
for you remember brothers our labor and toil night and day we were working so that we might not be a burden to any of you as we preached to you the gospel of god 
you are witnesses and god also how holy righteous and blameless was our behavior toward you who believe
in the same way you know how we were with each one of you as a father with his own children
exhorting you and comforting you and urging you to walk in a manner that is worthy of god who calls you into his own kingdom and glory 
for this reason we also thank god constantly that when you received gods message that you heard from us you accepted it not as the word of man but just as it truly is the word of god which is also at work in you who believe 
for you brothers became imitators of the churches of god that are in judea in christ jesus for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the jews
who killed both the lord jesus and the prophets and who drove us out they do not please god instead they are hostile to all people
they forbid us to speak to the gentiles for them to be saved the result is that they always fill up their sins to the limit but wrath will overtake them in the end 
but we brothers were separated from you for a short time in person not in heart we were especially eager with great desire to see your faces
for we wished to come to youindeed i paul once and againbut satan stopped us
for what is our hope or joy or crown of pride in front of our lord jesus at his coming is it not you
for you are our glory and joy  
therefore when we could no longer bear it we thought it was good to be left behind at athens alone
we sent timothy our brother and fellow worker for god in the gospel of christ to strengthen and comfort you regarding your faith  some important and ancient greek copies read we sent timothy our brother and gods servant in the gospel of christ 
so that no one would be shaken by these tribulations for you yourselves know that for this we have been appointed 
truly when we were with you we told you in advance that we were about to suffer affliction and it happened just so as you know
for this reason when i could no longer endure it i sent that i might know about your faith perhaps the tempter had somehow tempted you and our labor was in vain 
but timothy came to us from you and brought us the good news of your faith and love he told us that you always have good memories of us and that you long to see us just as we also long to see you
because of this brothers we were comforted by you because of your faith in all our distress and affliction 
for now we live if you stand firm in the lord
for what thanks can we give to god for you for all the joy that we have before our god over you
night and day we pray very hard that we may see your face and provide what is lacking in your faith 
may our god and father himself and our lord jesus direct our way to you
may the lord make you increase and abound in love one for another and toward all people as we also do for you
may he strengthen your hearts so that they will be blameless in holiness before our god and father at the coming of our lord jesus with all his holy people  
finally brothers we earnestly appeal to you and exhort you in the lord jesus as you received instructions from us about how you must walk and please god also in this way walk so that you do so even more
for you know what instructions we gave you through the lord jesus 
for this is the will of god your sanctification that you avoid sexual immorality
that each of you knows how to possess his own vessel in holiness and honor
not in the passion of lust as the gentiles who do not know god
let no man transgress and wrong his brother in this matter for the lord is an avenger in all these things just as we forewarned you and testified 
for god did not call us to uncleanness but to holiness
therefore he who rejects this rejects not people but god who gives his holy spirit to you 
regarding brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write to you for you yourselves are taught by god to love one another
indeed you do this for all the brothers who are in all macedonia but we exhort you brothers to do this even more
we also exhort you to aspire to live quietly take care of your own responsibilities and labor with your hands just as we commanded you
so that you may walk properly before outsiders and not be in any need 
we do not want you to be uninformed brothers about those who sleep so that you do not grieve like the rest who do not have hope
for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so god will bring with jesus those who have fallen asleep in him
for this we say to you by the word of the lord that we who are alive who are left at the coming of the lord will surely not go before those who have fallen asleep 
for the lord himself will descend from heaven he will come with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of god and the dead in christ will rise first
then we who are alive who are left will together with them be caught up in the clouds to meet the lord in the air in this way we will always be with the lord
therefore comfort one another with these words  
now concerning the times and seasons brothers you have no need that anything be written to you
for you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the lord is coming like a thief in the night
when they say peace and safety then sudden destruction will come on them it will be like birth pains in a pregnant woman they will in no way escape 
but you brothers are not in darkness so that the day would overtake you like a thief
for you are all sons of the light and sons of the day we are not sons of the night or the darkness
so then let us not sleep as the rest do instead let us keep watch and be sober
for those who sleep do so at night and those who get drunk do so at night 
but since we belong to the day we must stay sober and put on faith and love as a breastplate and the hope of salvation for our helmet
for god did not appoint us for wrath but to obtain salvation through our lord jesus christ
who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live together with him
therefore comfort one another and build each other up just as you are already doing 
we earnestly appeal to you brothers to acknowledge those who labor among you and who rule over you in the lord and who instruct you
and to esteem them highly in love because of their work be at peace among yourselves
we exhort you brothers warn those who are lazy encourage the discouraged help the weak and be patient toward all 
see that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone instead pursue what is good for one another and for all
rejoice always
pray without ceasing
in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus for you 
do not quench the spirit
do not despise prophecies
test all things hold firmly to what is good
keep away from every kind of evil 
may the god of peace sanctify you completely may your whole spirit soul and body be preserved blameless for the coming of our lord jesus christ
faithful is he who calls you the one who will also do it 
brothers pray also for us
greet all the brothers with a holy kiss
i command you by the lord to have this letter read to all the brothers
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you.
paul silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ 
we should always give thanks to god for you brothers as is appropriate because your faith is growing more and more and the love each of you has for one another increases
so we ourselves boast about you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the tribulations that you are enduring
this is evidence of gods righteous judgment so that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of god for which you are also suffering 
for indeed it is righteous for god to return affliction to those who afflict you
and relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
in flaming fire inflicting vengeance on those who do not know god and on those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus 
they will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction away from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power
he will do this when he comes on that day to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at by all those who believed because our testimony to you was believed 
because of this we also pray continually for you that our god may consider you worthy of your calling and with his power he may fulfill every good purpose and every work of faith
we pray this so that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ  
now about the coming of our lord jesus christ and our being gathered together to be with him we earnestly appeal to you brothers
that you not be easily disturbed or troubled either by a spirit or by a message or by a letter that seems to be coming from us to the effect that the day of the lord has already come 
let no one deceive you in any way for it will not come until after the falling away comes and the man of lawlessness is revealed the son of destruction  some important and ancient greek copies read and the man of sin is revealed 
this is he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called god or that is worshiped as a result he sits in the temple of god and exhibits himself as god 
do you not remember that when i was with you i told you these things
now you know what restrains him so that he will be revealed only at the right time
for the mystery of lawlessness is already working only there is someone who restrains him now until he is taken out of the way 
then the lawless one will be revealed whom the lord jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring him to nothing by the revelation of his coming
the coming of the lawless one will be due to the work of satan with all power signs and false wonders
and with every kind of evil that deceives those who are perishing because they refused to love the truth and so be saved 
for this reason god is sending them a powerful delusion so that they will believe a lie
and so that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but instead took pleasure in unrighteousness 
but we should always give thanks to god for you brothers loved by the lord because god chose you as the firstfruits to be saved through the sanctification by the spirit and belief in the truth  some important and ancient greek copies read for god chose you from the first for salvation 
he called you to this through our gospel so that you might obtain the glory of our lord jesus christ
so then brothers stand firm and hold tightly to the traditions that you were taught whether by word or by our letter 
now may our lord jesus christ himself and god our father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace
comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word  
now brothers pray for us that the word of the lord may rush and be glorified as it also is with you
and that we may be delivered from unrighteous and evil people for not all have faith
but the lord is faithful who will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one 
we have confidence in the lord about you that you both do and will continue to do the things that we command
may the lord direct your hearts to the love of god and to the endurance of christ 
now we command you brothers in the name of our lord jesus christ that you avoid every brother who is idle and does not live according to the traditions you received from us
for you yourselves know it is proper for you to imitate us because we were not idle when we were with you
we did not eat anyones bread without paying for it but we worked night and day in labor and toil so we might not be a burden to any of you
we did this not because we have no authority but we did this in order to be an example to you so that you may imitate us 
for when we were with you we commanded you the one who is unwilling to labor must not eat
for we hear that some among you are idle not busy at labor but busybodies
now such ones we command and exhort in the lord jesus christ that they should labor with quietness and eat their own bread 
but you brothers do not become tired of doing well
and if anyone does not obey our word in this letter take note of him and have no association with him so that he may be ashamed
yet do not consider him as an enemy but warn him as a brother 
now may the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways the lord be with you all
i paul write this with my own hand which is the mark on every letter i write
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all. amen.
paul an apostle of christ jesus according to the commandment of god our savior and christ jesus our hope
to timothy a true son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord 
as i urged you to do when i was leaving for macedonia remain in ephesus so that you can command certain people not to teach a different doctrine
neither should they pay attention to stories and endless genealogies these promote arguments rather than the plan of god which is by faith 
now the goal of the commandment is love from a pure heart from a good conscience and from a sincere faith
some people have gone astray from these things and have turned to worthless talk
they want to be teachers of the law but they do not understand what they are saying or what they so confidently affirm
but we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully 
we know this that law is not set in place for a righteous man but for lawless and rebellious people for ungodly people and sinners and for those who are unholy and profane for those who kill their fathers and mothers for murderers
for sexually immoral people for those who practice homosexuality for those who kidnap people for slaves for liars for false witnesses and for whatever else is opposed to truthful teaching
this instruction is according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god with which i have been entrusted 
i thank christ jesus our lord he strengthened me for he considered me faithful and he appointed me to service
i was a blasphemer a persecutor and a violent man but i received mercy because i acted ignorantly in unbelief
and the grace of our lord overflowed with the faith and the love that is in christ jesus 
this message is reliable and worthy of all acceptance that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief
but for this reason i was given mercy so that in me the chief christ jesus might demonstrate all patience he did this as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life
now to the king of the ages the immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever amen 
i am placing this command before you timothy my child in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you that you might fight the good fight
holding faith and a good conscience by rejecting this some have shipwrecked their faith
such are hymenaeus and alexander whom i delivered over to satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme  
therefore first of all i urge that humble requests prayers petitions and thanksgivings be made for all people
for kings and all who are in authority in order that we may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity
this is good and acceptable before god our savior
he desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth 
for there is one god and there is one mediator for god and man the man christ jesus
he gave himself as a ransom for all as the testimony at the right time
for this purpose i was appointed a herald and an apostlei am telling the truth i am not lyingand a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth 
therefore i want men in every place to pray and to lift up holy hands without anger or arguing
in the same way the women are to dress with proper clothing with modesty and selfcontrol not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothing
but with what is proper for women who proclaim godliness through good works 
a woman should learn in silence and with all submission
i do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man but to live in quietness 
for adam was formed first then eve
adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor
however she will be saved through bearing children if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with selfcontrol  
this saying is trustworthy if someone desires to be an overseer he desires a good work
therefore the overseer must have a good reputation he must be a husband of one wife he must be moderate sensible orderly and hospitable he must be able to teach
he must not be addicted to wine not a brawler but instead gentle peaceful he must not be a lover of money 
he should manage his own household well and he should make sure his children obey and respect him in every way
for if a man does not know how to manage his own household how will he care for a church of god 
he should not be a new convert so that he does not swell with pride and fall into condemnation as the devil
he must also have a good reputation with those outside so that he does not fall into disgrace and the trap of the devil 
in the same way deacons should be dignified not doubletalkers they should not drink too much wine or be greedy
they should keep the mystery of the faith with a clean conscience
they should also be approved first and then they should serve because they are blameless 
in the same way their wives should be dignified not slanderers but sober and faithful in all things
deacons must be husbands of one wife they must manage well their children and household
for those who have served well acquire for themselves a good standing and great confidence in the faith that is in christ jesus 
as i write these things to you i hope to come to you soon
but if i delay i am writing so that you may know how to conduct yourself in the household of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and support of the truth 
we all agree that the mystery of godliness is great he was revealed in the flesh was vindicated by the spirit was seen by angels was proclaimed among nations was believed on in the world and was taken up in glory  
now the spirit clearly says that in later times some people will leave the faith and pay attention to deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons
by the hypocrisy of liars their own consciences having been seared 
they will forbid people to marry and require them to abstain from foods that god created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth
for every creation of god is good and nothing received with thanksgiving is to be rejected
for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer 
if you place these things before the brothers you will be a good servant of jesus christ for you are being nourished by the words of faith and by the good teaching that you have followed
but reject profane stories loved by old women instead train yourself in godliness
for bodily training is a little useful but godliness is useful for all things it holds promise for this life now and the life to come 
this message is trustworthy and worthy of full acceptance
for it is for this that we labor and struggle for we hope in the living god who is the savior of all people but especially of believers 
instruct the people and teach these things
let no one despise your youth but be an example for the believers in speech conduct love faithfulness and purity
until i come attend to the reading to the exhortation and to the teaching 
do not neglect the gift that is in you which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the elders
care for these things be in them so that your progress may be evident to all people
give careful attention to yourself and to the teaching continue in these things for by doing so you will save yourself and those who listen to you  
do not rebuke an older man instead exhort him as if he were a father exhort younger men as brothers
older women as mothers and younger women as sisters in all purity 
honor widows the real widows
but if a widow has children or grandchildren let them first learn to show honor in their own household let them repay their parents because this is pleasing to god 
but she who is a real widow who is left all alone has set her hope in god and continues in offering earnest appeals and prayers night and day
but the woman who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives 
instruct them in these things as well so that they may be blameless
but if someone does not provide for his own relatives especially for those of his own household he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever 
let a woman be enrolled as a widow who is not younger than sixty years old a wife of one husband
she must have a reputation for doing good deeds whether it is that she has cared for children or has been hospitable to strangers or has washed the feet of gods holy people or has relieved the afflicted or has been devoted to every good work 
but as for younger widows refuse to enroll them in the list for when they give in to bodily desires against christ they want to marry
in this way they incur condemnation because they set aside their first commitment
at the same time they also learn to be lazy and they go around from house to house they not only become lazy but they also talk nonsense and are busybodies saying things they should not say 
i therefore want younger widows to marry to bear children to manage the household and to give no opportunity for the enemy to slander us
for some have already turned aside after satan
if any believing woman has widows let her help them so that the church will not be burdened so that it might help the real widows 
let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor especially those who labor with the word and in teaching
for the scripture says you must not put a muzzle on an ox while it threshes the grain and the laborer is worthy of his wages 
do not receive an accusation against an elder unless there are two or three witnesses
correct sinners before all so that the rest may be afraid 
i solemnly command you before god and christ jesus and the chosen angels to keep these commands without partiality and to do nothing out of favoritism
place hands hastily on no one do not share in the sins of another person you should keep yourself pure 
you should no longer drink water instead you should take a little wine for the stomach and your frequent sicknesses
the sins of some people are openly known and they go before them into judgment but some sins follow later
in the same way some good works are openly known but even the others cannot be hidden  
let all who are under the yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor they should do this so that the name of god and the teaching might not be blasphemed
the slaves who have believing masters should not show them disrespect because they are brothers instead they should serve them all the more for those who receive the benefit are believers and beloved teach and declare these things 
if anyone teaches false doctrine and does not agree with the truthful words of our lord jesus christ and with godly teaching
he is proud and understands nothing he has an unhealthy interest in controversies and arguments about words that result in envy strife insults evil suspicions
and constant conflict between people who have morally corrupt minds they have lost the truth and they think that godliness is a way to get more money  some old copies add the exhortation stay away from such things but the best ancient copies do not 
now godliness with contentment is great gain
for we brought nothing into the world and we can take nothing out of it
instead let us be satisfied with food and clothing 
now those who desire to become wealthy fall into temptation into a trap they fall into many foolish and harmful desires and into whatever else sinks people into ruin and destruction
for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil some people who desire it have been misled away from the faith and have pierced themselves with much grief 
but you man of god flee from these things pursue righteousness godliness faithfulness love endurance and gentleness
fight the good fight of faith take hold of the everlasting life to which you were called and about which you gave the good confession before many witnesses 
i give these orders to you before god who gives life to all things and before christ jesus who testified before pontius pilate and made the good confession
to keep the command without spot or blame until the appearance of our lord jesus christ 
god will reveal christs appearing at the right timegod the blessed and only sovereign the king who reigns and the lord who rules
only he has immortality and dwells in inapproachable light no man sees him or is able to view him to him be honor and eternal dominion amen 
instruct the rich in this world not to be proud and not to hope in riches which are uncertain instead they should hope in god he offers to us all the true riches to enjoy
tell them to do good to be rich in good works and to be generous and willing to share
in that way they will store up for themselves a good foundation for what is to come so that they will take hold of real life 
timothy protect what was given to you avoid the profane and empty talk and the conflicting ideas of what is falsely called knowledge
some men proclaim these things and so they have gone astray from the faith. may grace be with you.
paul an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god according to the promise of the life that is in christ jesus
to timothy beloved child grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord 
i thank god whom i serve from my forefathers with a clean conscience as i constantly remember you in my prayers night and day
as i remember your tears i long to see you that i may be filled with joy
i have been reminded of your genuine faith which lived first in your grandmother lois and your mother eunice and i am convinced that it lives in you also 
this is the reason i am reminding you to rekindle the gift of god which is in you through the laying on of my hands
for god did not give us a spirit of fear but of power and love and discipline 
so do not be ashamed of the testimony about our lord nor of me paul his prisoner instead share in suffering for the gospel according to the power of god
who saved us and called us with a holy calling he did this not according to our works but according to his own plan and grace which he gave us in christ jesus before times ever began
but now gods salvation has been revealed by the appearing of our savior christ jesus who put an end to death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel
because of this i was appointed a herald an apostle and a teacher  some important and ancient greek copies add to the gentiles  
for this cause i also suffer these things but i am not ashamed for i know him whom i have believed i am convinced that he is able to keep that which i have entrusted to him until that day
keep the example of the truthful words that you heard from me with the faith and love that are in christ jesus
the good thing that god committed to you guard it through the holy spirit who lives in us 
you know this that all who live in asia turned away from me in this group are phygelus and hermogenes
may the lord grant mercy to the household of onesiphorus for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain
instead when he was in rome he sought me diligently and he found me
may the lord grant to him to find mercy from him on that day all the ways he served me in ephesus you know very well  
you therefore my child be strengthened in the grace that is in christ jesus
the things you heard from me among many witnesses entrust them to faithful people who will be able to teach others also 
suffer hardship with me as a good soldier of christ jesus
no soldier serves while entangled in the affairs of this life so that he may please his superior officer
also if someone competes as an athlete he is not crowned unless he competes by the rules 
it is necessary that the hardworking farmer receive his share of the crops first
think about what i am saying for the lord will give you understanding in everything 
remember jesus christ a descendant of david who was raised from the dead this is according to my gospel message
for which i am suffering to the point of being bound with chains as a criminal but the word of god is not bound
therefore i endure all things for those who are chosen so that they also may obtain the salvation that is in christ jesus with eternal glory 
this is a trustworthy saying if we have died with him we will also live with him
if we endure we will also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us
if we are unfaithful he remains faithful for he cannot deny himself 
keep reminding them of these things command them before god not to quarrel about words it is of no value and only ruins those who listen  some important and ancient greek copies read warn them before the lord 
do your best to present yourself to god as one approved a laborer who has no reason to be ashamed who accurately teaches the word of truth 
avoid profane and empty talk which leads to more and more godlessness
their talk will spread like cancer among them are hymenaeus and philetus
who have gone astray from the truth they say that the resurrection has already happened and they destroy the faith of some 
however the firm foundation of god stands it has this inscription the lord knows those who are his and everyone who names the name of the lord must depart from unrighteousness
in a wealthy home there are not only containers of gold and silver there are also containers of wood and clay some of these are for honorable use and some for dishonorable
if someone cleans himself from dishonorable use he is an honorable container he is set apart useful to the master and prepared for every good work 
flee youthful lusts pursue righteousness faith love and peace with those who call on the lord out of a clean heart
but refuse foolish and ignorant questions you know that they give birth to quarrels 
the lords servant must not quarrel instead he must be gentle toward all able to teach and patient
correcting his opponents with gentleness perhaps god may give them repentance for the knowledge of the truth
they may become sober again and leave the devils trap after they have been captured by him for his will  
but know this in the last days there will be difficult times
for people will be lovers of themselves lovers of money boastful proud blasphemers disobedient to parents ungrateful and unholy
they will be without natural affection unable to reconcile slanderers without selfcontrol violent not lovers of good
they will be betrayers reckless prideful lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god 
they will have a shape of godliness but they will deny its power turn away from these people
for some of them are men who enter into households and captivate foolish women these are women who are loaded up with sins and are led away by various desires
these women are always learning but they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth 
in the same way that jannes and jambres stood against moses these false teachers also stand against the truth they are men corrupt in mind and with regard to the faith they are rejected
but they will not advance very far for their foolishness will be obvious to all just like that of those men 
but as for you you have followed my teaching conduct purpose faith longsuffering love patience
persecutions sufferings and what happened to me at antioch at iconium and at lystra i endured persecutions out of them all the lord rescued me
all those who want to live in a godly manner in christ jesus will be persecuted
evil people and impostors will go from bad to worse leading others astray and being led astray 
but as for you remain in the things that you have learned and have firmly believed you know from whom you have learned
you know that from childhood you have known the sacred writings these are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in christ jesus 
all scripture has been inspired by god it is profitable for doctrine for conviction for correction and for training in righteousness
this is so that the man of god may be competent equipped for every good work  
i give this solemn command before god and christ jesus who will judge the living and the dead and because of his appearing and his kingdom
preach the word be ready when it is convenient and when it is not reprove rebuke exhort with all patience and teaching 
for the time will come when people will not endure sound teaching instead they will heap up for themselves teachers according to their own desires who say what their itching ears want to hear
they will turn their hearing away from the truth and they will turn aside to myths
but you be soberminded in all things suffer hardship do the work of an evangelist fulfill your ministry 
for i am already being poured out the time of my departure has come
i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith
the crown of righteousness has been reserved for me which the lord the righteous judge will give to me on that day and not to me only but also to all those who have loved his appearing 
do your best to come to me quickly
for demas has left me he loves this present world and has gone to thessalonica crescens went to galatia and titus went to dalmatia 
only luke is with me get mark and bring him with you because he is useful to me in the service
tychicus i sent to ephesus
the cloak that i left at troas with carpus bring it when you come and the books especially the parchments 
alexander the coppersmith displayed many evil deeds against me the lord will repay him according to his deeds
you also should guard yourself against him because he greatly opposed our words
at my first defense no one stood with me instead everyone left me may it not be counted against them 
but the lord stood by me and strengthened me so that through me the proclamation of the message might be fully accomplished and that all the gentiles might hear it and i was rescued out of the lions mouth
the lord will rescue me from every evil deed and will save me for his heavenly kingdom to him be the glory forever and ever amen 
greet priscilla aquila and the house of onesiphorus
erastus remained at corinth but trophimus i left sick at miletus
do your best to come before winter eubulus greets you also pudens linus claudia and all the brothers
may the lord be with your spirit. may grace be with you.
paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ for the faith of gods chosen people and the knowledge of the truth that agrees with godliness
with the hope of everlasting life that god who does not lie promised before all the ages of time
at the right time he revealed his word through the preaching with which i have been entrusted according to the command of god our savior 
to titus a true son in our common faith grace and peace from god the father and christ jesus our savior
for this purpose i left you in crete that you might set in order things not yet complete and ordain elders in every city as i directed you 
an elder must be blameless the husband of one wife with faithful children not accused of being reckless or disobedient
it is necessary for the overseer as a manager of the household of god to be blameless he must not be arrogant not be easily angered not addicted to wine not a brawler and not a greedy man 
instead he should be hospitable loving goodness sensible upright holy and selfcontrolled
he should hold tightly to the trustworthy message that was taught so that he may be able to encourage others with truthful teaching and correct those who oppose him 
for there are many rebellious people empty talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision
it is necessary to stop them they are upsetting whole families by teaching for disgraceful profit what they should not teach 
one of their own prophets has said cretans are always liars evil beasts lazy gluttons
this testimony is true therefore correct them severely so that they may be truthful in the faith
not paying any attention to jewish myths or to the commands of people who turn away from the truth 
to those who are pure all things are pure but to those who are corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure but both their minds and their consciences have been corrupted
they profess to know god but they deny him by their actions they are detestable disobedient and worthless for any good work  
but you speak what fits with truthful instruction
teach older men to be temperate dignified sensible and sound in faith in love and in perseverance 
in the same way teach older women to be reverent in behavior not slanderers or being slaves to much wine but to be teachers of what is good
and so train the younger women to love their husbands and to love their children
to be sensible pure good housekeepers and to be obedient to their own husbands so that gods word may not be spoken of as evil 
in the same way encourage the younger men to use good sense
in all ways present yourself as an example of good works in your teaching show integrity dignity
and a truthful message that is above criticism so that anyone who opposes you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us 
slaves are to be submissive to their masters in everything to please them and not argue with them
to not steal from them but instead to demonstrate all good faith so that in every way they may bring credit to the teaching about god our savior 
for the grace of god has appeared for the salvation of all people
it trains us to reject godlessness and worldly desires and to live selfcontrolled upright and godly lives in this age
while we look forward to receiving our blessed hope the appearance of the glory of our great god and savior jesus christ 
jesus gave himself for us in order to redeem us from all lawlessness and to make pure for himself a special people who are eager to do good works 
speak of these things encourage people to do them and give correction with all authority let no one disregard you  
remind them to submit to rulers and authorities to obey them to be ready for every good work
to insult no one to not be eager to fight and to be gentle showing all humility toward everyone 
for once we ourselves were thoughtless and disobedient we were led astray and enslaved by various desires and pleasures we lived in evil and envy we were detestable and hated one another 
but when the kindness of god our savior and his love for mankind appeared
it was not by works of righteousness that we did but by his mercy that he saved us through the washing of new birth and renewal by the holy spirit 
whom god richly poured on us through our savior jesus christ
so that having been justified by his grace we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life 
this message is trustworthy i want you to insist on these things so that those who have believed in god may be careful to engage themselves in good works these things are good and useful for everyone 
but avoid foolish debates and genealogies and strife and conflict about the law those things are unprofitable and worthless
reject anyone who is causing divisions among you after one or two warnings
knowing that such a person has turned from the right way and is sinning and condemns himself 
when i send artemas or tychicus to you hurry and come to me at nicopolis where i have decided to spend the winter
do everything you can to send on their way zenas the lawyer and apollos so that they lack nothing 
our people must learn to engage themselves in good works that provide for urgent needs and so not be unfruitful 
all those who are with me greet you. greet those who love us in faith. grace be with all of you.
paul a prisoner of christ jesus and the brother timothy to philemon our dear friend and fellow worker
and to apphia our sister and to archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home
may grace be to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ 
i always thank my god when i mention you in my prayers
because i hear about the faith that you have toward the lord jesus and the love you have for all his holy people
i pray that the sharing of your faith may be effective so you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in christ
for i have had much joy and comfort because of your love because the hearts of gods holy people have been refreshed by you brother 
therefore although i have all the boldness in christ to command you to do what you should do
yet because of love i appeal to you insteadi paul an old man and now a prisoner for christ jesus 
i am appealing to you concerning my child onesimus whom i have fathered in my chains
for he once was useless to you but now he is useful both to you and to me
i have sent him back to you he who is my very heart
i wish i could have kept him with me so he could serve me for you while i am in chains for the sake of the gospel 
but i did not want to do anything without your consent i did not want your good deed to be from necessity but from good will
perhaps for this he was separated from you for a time so that you might have him back forever
no longer would he be a slave but better than a slave a beloved brother he is beloved especially to me and much more so to you in both the flesh and in the lord 
so if you have me as a partner receive him as me
if he has wronged you or owes you anything charge that to me
i paul write this with my own hand i myself will pay it backnot to mention that you owe me your own self
yes brother let me benefit from you in the lord refresh my heart in christ 
confident about your obedience i am writing to you i know that you will do even more than i ask
at the same time prepare a guest room for me for i hope that through your prayers i will be returned to you 
epaphras my fellow prisoner in christ jesus greets you
so do mark aristarchus demas and luke my fellow workers
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit. amen.
long ago god spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in many ways
but in these last days he has spoken to us through a son whom he appointed to be the heir of all things it is through him that god also made the universe
he is the brightness of gods glory the exact representation of his being he even holds everything together by the word of his power after he had made cleansing for sins he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high 
he has become just as superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than their name
for to which of the angels did god ever say you are my son  today i have become your father or to which of the angels did god ever say i will be a father to him  and he will be a son to me 
but again when god brings the firstborn into the world he says all gods angels must worship him
about the angels he says he is the one who makes his angels spirits  and his servants flames of fire 
but to the son he says your throne god is forever and ever  the scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom
you have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness  therefore god your god has anointed you  with the oil of joy more than your companions 
in the beginning lord you laid the earths foundation  the heavens are the work of your hands
they will perish but you will continue  they will all wear out like a piece of clothing
you will roll them up like a cloak  and they will be changed like a piece of clothing but you are the same  and your years do not end 
but to which of the angels has god said at any time sit at my right hand  until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet
are not all angels spirits who serve and who are sent to care for those who will inherit salvation  
therefore we must give far more attention to what we have heard so that we do not drift away from it 
for if the message that was spoken through the angels proved to be so reliable and every transgression and disobedience receives just repayment
how then can we escape if we ignore so great a salvation this is salvation that was first announced by the lord and confirmed to us by those who heard it
at the same time god testified to it by signs wonders and various miracles and by distributing the gifts of the holy spirit according to his will 
for it was not to the angels that god subjected the world to come about which we are speaking
but someone has somewhere testified saying what is man that you are mindful of him  or a son of man that you care for him 
you made man a little lower than the angels  you crowned him with glory and honor  some important and ancient greek copies add and you have put him over the works of your hands 
you put everything in subjection under his feet for it was to him that god has subjected all things he did not leave anything not subjected to him but now we do not yet see everything subjected to him 
but we see him who was made lower than the angels for a little while jesus crowned with glory and honor because of his suffering and death so that by gods grace he might taste death for everyone
for it was proper for god because everything exists for him and through him to bring many sons to glory it was proper for him to make the founder of their salvation complete through his sufferings 
for both the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified have one source so he is not ashamed to call them brothers
he says i will proclaim your name to my brothers  i will sing about you from inside the assembly 
and again i will trust in him and again see here am i and the children whom god has given me
therefore since the children share in flesh and blood he shared in those things in the same way so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death that is the devil
this was so that he would free all those who through fear of death lived all their lives subject to slavery 
for surely it is not the angels he helps but abrahams descendants
so it was necessary for him to become like his brothers in all ways so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest in relation to the things of god and so that he could make atonement for the sins of the people
because jesus himself has suffered and was tempted he is able to help those who are tempted  
therefore holy brothers you share in a heavenly calling think about jesus the apostle and high priest of our confession
he was faithful to god who appointed him just as moses was also faithful in all the house of god
for jesus has been considered worthy of greater glory than moses because the one who builds a house has more honor than the house itself
for every house is built by someone but the one who built everything is god 
for moses was faithful as a servant in gods entire house bearing witness about the things that were to be spoken of in the future
but christ is faithful as a son who is in charge of the house of god we are his house if we hold firmly to our courage and the hope of which we boast 
therefore it is just as the holy spirit says today if you hear his voice
do not harden your hearts  as in the rebellion  in the time of testing in the wilderness 
this was when your ancestors rebelled by testing me  after they had seen my deeds for forty years
therefore i was angry with that generation  i said they have always gone astray in their hearts  they have not known my ways
it is just as i swore in my wrath  they will never enter my rest 
be careful brothers that none of you has an evil heart of unbelief a heart that turns away from the living god
but encourage one another daily as long as it is called today so that no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin 
for we have become partners of christ if we firmly hold to our confidence in him from the beginning to the end
about this it has been said today if you hear his voice  do not harden your hearts  as in the rebellion 
who was it who heard god and rebelled was it not all those who came out of egypt through moses
with whom was he angry for forty years was it not with those who sinned whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness
to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest if it was not to those who disobeyed him
we see that they were not able to enter his rest because of unbelief  
therefore since the promise of entering his rest is still allowed to stand let us fear so that none of you may seem to have fallen short of it
for we were told the good news just as they were but that message did not benefit those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed  some important and ancient copies read but that message did not benefit those who heard it without joining faith to it  
for we who have believed enter that rest just as he said as i swore in my wrath  they will never enter my rest even so his works were finished from the foundation of the world
for he has somewhere spoken about the seventh day and god rested on the seventh day from all his works
and again in this same passage he said they will never enter my rest 
therefore it remains for some to enter that rest and those who previously had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience
so god again appointed a certain day calling it today when he spoke through david much later in words already quoted today if you hear his voice  do not harden your hearts 
for if joshua had given them rest god would not have spoken about another day
so there remains a sabbath rest reserved for gods people
for he who enters into gods rest has himself also rested from his deeds just as god did from his
therefore let us be eager to enter that rest so that no one will fall into the kind of disobedience that they did 
for the word of god is living and active and sharper than any twoedged sword it pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit of joints and marrow and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart
no thing that has been created is hidden before god but everything is bare and open to the eyes of the one to whom we must give an account 
therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens jesus the son of god let us firmly hold to our confession
for we do not have a high priest who cannot feel sympathy for our weaknesses rather we have someone who has in all ways been tempted as we are except that he is without sin
let us then go with confidence to the throne of grace so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need  
for every high priest chosen from among people is appointed to act on the behalf of people in the things concerning god so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
he can deal gently with those who are ignorant and who have been deceived because he himself is subject to weakness
because of this he also is required to offer sacrifices for his own sins just as he does for the peoples sins 
no one takes this honor for himself rather he is called by god just as aaron was
in the same way neither did christ glorify himself by making himself high priest instead the one speaking to him said you are my son  today i have become your father 
it is just as he also says in another place you are a priest forever  after the manner of melchizedek 
during the days of his flesh christ offered up both prayers and requests with loud cries and tears to god the one able to save him from death and he was heard because of his godly life
even though he was a son he learned obedience from what he suffered 
he was made perfect and became for everyone who obeys him the cause of eternal salvation
he was designated by god as high priest after the manner of melchizedek
we have much to say about jesus but it is hard to explain since you have become dull in hearing 
for though by this time you should be teachers you still have need for someone to teach you the elementary principles of gods messages you need milk not solid food
for anyone who only takes milk is inexperienced with the message of righteousness because he is still a little child
but solid food is for the mature these are those who because of their maturity have their understanding trained for distinguishing good from evil  
so then let us leave the beginning of the message of christ and move forward to maturity let us not lay again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in god
nor the foundation of teaching about baptisms laying on of hands the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment
we will also do this if god permits 
for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened who tasted the heavenly gift who were sharers of the holy spirit
and who tasted gods good word and the powers of the age to come
but who then fell awayit is impossible to restore them again to repentance this is because they crucify the son of god for themselves again and publicly shame him 
for the land that drinks in the rain that often comes on it and that gives birth to the plants useful to those for whom the land was workedthis is the land that receives a blessing from god
but if it bears thorns and thistles it is worthless and is near to a curse its end is in burning 
but we are convinced about better things concerning you beloved onesthings that concern salvationeven though we speak like this
for god is not unjust he will not forget your work and the love you showed for his name because you served his holy people and you are still serving them 
we greatly desire that each of you may show the same diligence to the end in order to make your hope certain
this is so that you will not become lazy but imitators of those who by faith and patience inherit the promises 
for when god made his promise to abraham he swore by himself since he could not swear by anyone greater
he said i will certainly bless you and give you many descendants
in this way abraham obtained what was promised after he had patiently waited 
for people swear by someone greater than themselves at the end of each of their disputes an oath serves as confirmation
when god decided to show more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable quality of his purpose he guaranteed it with an oath
he did this so that by two unchangeable thingswith which it is impossible for god to liewe who have fled for refuge will have a strong encouragement to hold firmly to the hope set before us 
we have this as a secure and reliable anchor for the soul a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain
where jesus who went before us has entered into that place on our behalf he has become a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek  
it was this melchizedek king of salem priest of god most high who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him
it was to him that abraham gave a tenth of everything first the translation of his name means king of righteousness then he is also king of salem that is king of peace
he is without father without mother without ancestors with neither beginning of days nor end of life and resembling the son of god he remains a priest forever 
see how great this man was to whom the patriarch abraham gave a tenth of the things that he had taken in battle
the descendants of levi who receive the priestly office have a command according to the law to collect tithes from the people that is from their brothers even though they too are descended from abraham
but melchizedek whose descent was not traced from them received tithes from abraham and blessed him the one who had the promises 
there is no denying that the lesser person is blessed by the greater person
in this case mortal men receive tithes but in that case it is testified that he lives on
and in a manner of speaking levi who received tithes also paid tithes through abraham
because levi was in the body of his ancestor when melchizedek met abraham 
now if perfection were possible through the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the manner of melchizedek and not be considered to be after the manner of aaron
for when the priesthood is changed the law must also be changed 
for the one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe from which no one has ever served at the altar
now clearly it is from judah that our lord was born a tribe that moses never mentioned concerning priests 
what we say is even clearer when another priest arises in the likeness of melchizedek
this one became a priest not based on a law of physical requirement but by the power of an everlasting life
for scripture witnesses about him you are a priest forever  according to the order of melchizedek 
for not only has the former command been set aside because it is weak and useless
for the law made nothing perfectbut also a better hope is introduced through which we come near to god 
and it was not without an oath others became priests without any oath
but he became a priest with an oath by the one who said to him the lord has sworn and he will not change his mind  you are a priest forever 
by this also jesus has given the guarantee of a better covenant
the former priests were many in number since death prevented them from continuing in office
but because jesus continues to live forever he has a permanent priesthood 
therefore he is also able to save completely those who approach god through him because he always lives to intercede for them
for it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest who is holy innocent pure separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens 
he does not need unlike the high priests to offer up daily sacrifices first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people he did this once for all when he offered himself
for the law appoints as high priests men who have weaknesses but the word of the oath which came after the law appointed a son who has been made perfect forever  
now the point of what we are saying is this we have a high priest who has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens
he is a servant in the holy place the true tabernacle that the lord not a man set up 
for every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices therefore it is necessary to have something to offer
now if christ were on earth he would not be a priest at all since there are those who offer the gifts according to the law
they serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things it is just as moses was warned by god when he was about to construct the tabernacle god said see that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain 
but now christ has received a much better ministry just as he is also the mediator of a better covenant which is based on better promises
for if that first covenant had been faultless no occasion for a second would have been sought 
for when god found fault with the people he said see the days are comingsays the lord  when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel  and with the house of judah
it will not be like the covenant  that i made with their ancestors on the day that i took them by their hand  to lead them out of the land of egypt for they did not carefully obey my covenant  and i disregarded them  says the lord 
this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel  after those days says the lord i will put my laws into their minds  and i will also write them on their hearts i will be their god  and they will be my people 
they will not teach each one his fellow citizen  and each one his brother saying know the lord for they will all know me  from the least of them to the greatest
for i will be merciful toward their evil deeds  and their sins i will not remember any longer 
by calling this covenant new he declared the first covenant to be obsolete and what has become obsolete and old will soon disappear  
now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary
for a tabernacle was prepared the first room in which were the lampstand the table and the bread of the presence was called the holy place 
behind the second curtain was another room in the tabernacle called the most holy place
it had a golden altar for incense it also had the ark of the covenant which was completely overlaid with gold inside it was a golden jar that held the manna aarons rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant
above the ark of the covenant glorious cherubim overshadowed the atonement lid which we cannot now talk about in detail 
after these things were prepared the priests always entered the outer room of the tabernacle to perform their services
but only the high priest entered the second room once each year and not without blood that he offered for himself and for the peoples unintentional sins 
the holy spirit showed that as long as the first tabernacle was still standing the way into the most holy place had not yet appeared
this was an illustration for the present time both the gifts and sacrifices that are now being offered are not able to perfect the worshipers conscience
they are only concerned with food and drink and various ceremonial washings regulations for the body until the time of the new order 
christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that was not made by human hands one not belonging to this created world  some important and ancient greek copies read christ came as a high priest of the good things that are to come 
it was not by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood that he entered into the most holy place once for all and secured our eternal redemption 
for if the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkling of a heifers ashes on those who have been defiled sanctifies them for the cleansing of their flesh
how much more will the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself unblemished to god cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living god
for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant this is so that since a death has taken place to redeem those under the first covenant from their transgressions those who are called will receive the promise of an eternal inheritance 
for where there is a will the death of the person who made it must be proven
for a will is only valid when there has been a death because it has no force while the one who made it is still alive 
so not even the first covenant was established without blood
for when moses had given every command in the law to all the people he took the blood of the calves and the goats with water red wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people
then he said this is the blood of the covenant that god has commanded for you 
in the same manner he sprinkled the blood on the tabernacle and all the containers used in the ministry
according to the law almost everything is cleansed with blood without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness 
therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these animal sacrifices however the heavenly things themselves had to be cleansed with much better sacrifices
for christ did not enter into the most holy place made with hands which is only a copy of the true one rather he entered into heaven itself to appear now in gods presence for us 
he did not go there in order to offer himself many times as does the high priest who enters the most holy place year by year with the blood of another
if that had been the case then he would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world but now he has appeared at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself 
just as man is appointed to die once and after that comes judgment
so also christ was offered once to take away the sins of many and will appear a second time not to deal with sin but for the salvation of those who are waiting for him  
for the law is only a shadow of the good things to come not the real forms of those things themselves those who approach god can never be made perfect by the same sacrifices that the priests continually bring year after year
otherwise would the sacrifices not have ceased to be offered for the worshipers would have been cleansed one time and would no longer have any consciousness of sin
but with those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year
for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins 
when christ came into the world he said sacrifices and offerings you did not desire  but a body you have prepared for me
with burnt offerings and sin offerings  you did not take pleasure
then i said see here i amas it is written about me in the scroll  to do your will god 
first he said it was neither sacrifices nor offerings nor whole burnt offerings nor sin offerings that you desired nor did you take pleasure in them these are sacrifices that are offered according to the law
then he said see here i am to do your will he takes away the first practice in order to establish the second practice
by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all 
day after day every priest stands and ministers offering the same sacrifices again and againsacrifices that can never take away sins
but when christ offered for all time one sacrifice for sins he sat down at the right hand of god
he is waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet
for by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified 
the holy spirit also testifies to us first he says
this is the covenant that i will make with them  after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their hearts  and i will write them on their minds 
then he adds their sins and lawlessness  i will remember no longer
now where there is forgiveness for these there is no longer any sacrifice for sin 
therefore brothers we have confidence to enter into the most holy place by the blood of jesus
that is the new and living way that he has established for us through the curtain that is by means of his flesh
because we have a great priest over the house of god
let us approach with true hearts in the full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water 
let us also hold firmly to the hope we confess for he who promised is faithful
let us think carefully about how to motivate one another to love and good deeds
let us not abandon meeting together as some have done instead encourage one another and all the more as you see the day coming closer 
for if we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth a sacrifice for sins no longer remains
instead there is only a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume gods enemies 
anyone who has rejected the law of moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses
how much worse punishment do you think one deserves who has trampled underfoot the son of god who has regarded the blood of the covenant as unholythe blood by which he was sanctifiedand has insulted the spirit of grace 
for we know the one who said vengeance belongs to me i will pay back and again the lord will judge his people
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god 
but remember the former days after you were enlightened how you endured a great struggle in suffering
sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution and other times you shared with those who were so treated
for you had compassion on those who were prisoners and you accepted with joy the seizure of your possessions you knew that you yourselves had a better and everlasting possession  some important and ancient greek copies read for you had compassion on me in my chains  
so do not throw away your confidence which has a great reward
for you need perseverance so that when you have done the will of god you will receive what he has promised
for in a very little while  the one who is coming will indeed come and not delay 
my righteous one will live by faith  if he shrinks back my soul will not be pleased with him
but we are not any of those who turn back to destruction but we are among those who have faith and preserve their souls  
now faith is being sure of the things hoped for and certain of things that are not seen
for because of this the ancestors were approved for their faith
by faith we understand that the universe was created by gods command so that what is visible was not made out of things that were visible 
it was by faith that abel offered god a better sacrifice than cain through which he was attested to be righteous and god spoke well of him because of his offerings and by faith abel still speaks even though he is dead 
it was by faith that enoch was taken up so that he did not see death he was not found because god took him away for before he was taken up it was testified that he had pleased god
now without faith it is impossible to please him for it is necessary that anyone coming to god must believe that he exists and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him 
it was by faith that noah having been given a divine message about things not yet seen with godly reverence built an ark to save his household by doing this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that is according to faith 
it was by faith that abraham when he was called obeyed and went out to the place that he was to receive as an inheritance he went out not knowing where he was going
it was by faith that he lived in the land of promise as a foreigner he lived in tents with isaac and jacob fellow heirs of the same promise
for he was looking forward to the city with foundations whose architect and builder is god 
it was by faith even though sarah herself was barren that she received ability to conceive this happened even though she was too old since she considered as faithful the one who had given the promise
therefore from this one manand he was almost deadwere born descendants as many as the stars in the sky and as countless as sand by the seashore 
it was in faith that all these died without receiving the promises rather they saw and greeted them from far off and they acknowledged that they were foreigners and exiles on earth
for those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland 
if they had been thinking of the country from which they had gone out they would have had opportunity to return
but as it is they desire a better country that is a heavenly one therefore god is not ashamed to be called their god since he has prepared a city for them 
it was by faith that abraham when he was tested offered isaac it was his only son whom he offered he who had received the promises
it was abraham to whom it had been said it is through isaac that your descendants will be named
abraham reasoned that god was able to raise up isaac from the dead and figuratively speaking it was from them that he received him back 
it was also by faith about things to come that isaac blessed jacob and esau
it was by faith that jacob when he was dying blessed each of josephs sons jacob worshiped leaning on the top of his staff
it was by faith that joseph when his end was near spoke of the departure of the children of israel from egypt and instructed them about his bones 
it was by faith that moses when he was born was hidden for three months by his parents because they saw he was a beautiful child they were not afraid of the kings command
it was by faith that moses after he had grown up refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter
he chose to be mistreated along with the people of god rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a while
he regarded disgrace for the sake of christ as of greater value than the treasures of egypt for he was looking ahead to his reward 
it was by faith that moses left egypt he did not fear the kings anger for he endured as if he were seeing the one who is invisible
it was by faith that he kept the passover and the sprinkling of the blood so that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch the israelites firstborn sons 
it was by faith that they passed through the sea of reeds as if over dry land when the egyptians tried to do this they were swallowed up
it was by faith that jerichos walls fell down after they had been circled around for seven days
it was by faith that rahab the prostitute did not die with those who were disobedient because she had received the spies in peace 
what more can i say for the time will fail me if i give a full account of gideon barak samson jephthah david samuel and about the prophets
it was through faith that they conquered kingdoms committed righteousness and received promises they stopped the mouths of lions
quenched the power of fire escaped the edge of the sword were made strong when they were weak became mighty in battle and defeated foreign armies 
women received back their dead by resurrection others were tortured not accepting release so that they might experience a better resurrection
others experienced mocking and whippings and even chains and imprisonment
they were stoned they were sawn in two they were killed with the sword they went about in sheepskins and goatskins they were destitute oppressed mistreated  some important and ancient greek copies read they were stoned they were sawn in two they were put to the test they were killed with the sword 
the world was not worthy of them they were always wandering about in the deserts and mountains and in caves and holes in the ground 
although all these people were approved by god because of their faith they did not receive the promise
god planned something better for us so that without us they would not be made perfect  
therefore since we are surrounded by such a large cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and easily entangling sin let us run with perseverance the race that is placed before us
let us pay attention to jesus the founder and perfecter of the faith for the joy that was placed before him he endured the cross despised its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god
so think about him the one who has endured such opposition from sinners against himself so that you do not become weary and lose heart 
you have not yet resisted or struggled against sin to the point of blood
and you have forgotten the encouragement that instructs you as sons my son do not think lightly of the lords discipline  nor grow weary when you are corrected by him
for the lord disciplines the one he loves  and he punishes every son he receives 
endure suffering as discipline god deals with you as with sons for what son is there whom his father does not discipline
but if you are without discipline which all people share in then you are illegitimate and not his sons 
furthermore we had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them how much more should we submit to the father of spirits and live
our fathers disciplined us for a short time as they thought best but god disciplines us for our benefit so that we can share in his holiness
no discipline at the time seems to give joy but to give sorrow but later it produces the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those who have been trained by it 
so strengthen your hands that hang down and your weak knees
make straight paths for your feet so that what is lame will not be sprained but rather be healed 
pursue peace with everyone and holiness for without it no one will see the lord
be careful so that no one lacks gods grace and that no root of bitterness grows up to cause trouble so that many do not become defiled by it
and that there is no one who is sexually immoral or profane such as esau who for one meal sold his own birthright
for you know that afterwards when he desired to inherit the blessing he was rejected because he found no opportunity for repentance even though he sought it with tears 
for you have not come to a mountain that can be touched a mountain of burning fire darkness gloom and storm
you have not come to a trumpet blast nor to a voice that speaks words whose hearers begged that not another word be spoken to them
for they could not endure what was commanded if even an animal touches the mountain it must be stoned  some important and ancient greek copies read if even an animal touches the mountain it must be stoned or shot with an arrow 
so fearful was this sight that moses said i am terrified and am trembling 
rather you have come to mount zion and to the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to tens of thousands of angels in joyful assembly
you have come to the congregation of the firstborn who have been registered in heaven you have come to god the judge of all and to the spirits of the righteous ones who have been made perfect
and you have come to jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood that speaks better than abels blood 
see that you do not refuse the one who is speaking for if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth much less will we escape if we turn away from the one who is warning from heaven
at one time his voice shook the earth but now he has promised and said one more time i will shake not only the earth but also the heavens 
these words one more time mean the removal of those things that can be shaken that is of the things that have been created so that the things that cannot be shaken will remain
therefore receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us be thankful and in this manner worship god with reverence and awe
for our god is a consuming fire  
let brotherly love continue
do not forget hospitality for strangers for through this some have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it 
remember prisoners as if you were bound with them remember those who are mistreated since you yourselves also are in the body
let marriage be held in honor by all and let the marriage bed be kept pure for god will judge sexually immoral people and adulterers 
let your conduct be free from the love of money be content with the things you have for god himself has said i will never leave you  nor will i abandon you
let us be content so that we may have courage to say the lord is my helper i will not be afraid  what can a man do to me 
consider your leaders those who spoke gods word to you and consider the result of their conduct imitate their faith
jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever 
do not be carried away by various strange teachings for it is good that the heart should be strengthened by grace not by foods that do not help those who walk by them
we have an altar from which those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat
for the blood of the animals killed for sins is brought by the high priest into the holy place while their bodies are burned outside the camp 
so jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood
let us therefore go to him outside the camp bearing the disgrace he endured
for we do not have a permanent city here rather we are looking for the one that is to come 
through him then let us always offer up sacrifices of praise to god praise that is the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name
let us not forget doing good and sharing for it is with such sacrifices that god is very pleased
obey and submit to your leaders for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give account obey so that your leaders will do this with joy and not with groaning which would be useless to you 
pray for us for we are convinced that we have a good conscience and that we desire to live rightly in all things
i encourage you even more to do this so that i will be returned to you sooner 
now may the god of peace who brought back from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep our lord jesus by the blood of the eternal covenant
equip you with everything good to do his will working in us what is pleasing to him through jesus christ to whom be the glory forever and ever amen 
now i encourage you brothers to bear with the word of encouragement that i have briefly written to you
know that our brother timothy has been set free with whom i will see you if he comes soon 
greet all your leaders and all gods holy people those from italy greet you
may grace be with you all.
james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes in the dispersion greetings
consider it all joy my brothers when you experience various troubles
you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance 
let endurance complete its work so that you may become fully developed and complete not lacking anything
but if any of you needs wisdom let him ask for it from god the one who gives generously and without rebuke to all who ask and he will give it to him 
but let him ask in faith doubting nothing for anyone who doubts is like a wave in the sea that is driven by the wind and tossed around
for that person must not think that he will receive anything from the lord
he is a doubleminded man unstable in all his ways 
let the lowly brother boast of his high position
but the rich man of his low position because he will pass away as a wild flower in the grass
for the sun rises with burning heat and dries up the grass the flower falls off and its beauty perishes in the same way the rich man will fade away in the middle of his journey 
blessed is the man who endures testing for after he has passed the test he will receive the crown of life which has been promised to those who love god
let no one say when he is tempted i am tempted by god because god is not tempted by evil nor does he himself tempt anyone 
but each person is tempted by his own desire which drags him away and entices him
then after the desire conceives it gives birth to sin and after the sin is full grown it gives birth to death
do not be deceived my beloved brothers 
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above it comes down from the father of lights with him there is no changing or shadow because of turning
god chose to give us birth by the word of truth so that we would be a kind of firstfruits of all his creatures 
you know this my beloved brothers let every man be quick to hear slow to speak and slow to anger
for the anger of man does not accomplish the righteousness of god
therefore take off all sinful filth and abundant amounts of evil in humility receive the implanted word which is able to save your souls 
be doers of the word and not only hearers deceiving yourselves
for if anyone is a hearer of the word but not a doer he is like a man who examines his natural face in a mirror
he examines himself and then goes away and immediately forgets what he was like
but the person who looks carefully into the perfect law of freedom and continues to do so not just being a hearer who forgets this man will be blessed in his actions 
if anyone thinks he is religious and does not control his tongue he deceives his heart and his religion is worthless
religion that is pure and unspoiled before our god and father is to help the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained by the world  
my brothers do not hold to faith in our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with partiality toward certain people
suppose that someone enters your meeting wearing gold rings and splendid clothes and there also enters a poor man in dirty clothes
if you look at the person wearing fine clothes and say you sit here in a good place but you say to the poor man you stand over there or sit by my footstool
are you not judging among yourselves have you not become judges with evil thoughts 
listen my beloved brothers did not god choose the poor of the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him
but you have dishonored the poor is it not the rich who oppress you are they not the ones who drag you to court
do they not insult the good name by which you have been called 
if however you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture love your neighbor as yourself you do well
but if you favor certain people you are committing sin and you are convicted by the law as transgressors 
for whoever obeys the whole law except that he stumbles in just a single way has become guilty of breaking the whole law
for the one who said do not commit adultery also said do not murder if you do not commit adultery but if you do commit murder you have become a transgressor of the law 
so speak and act as those who will be judged by means of the law of freedom
for judgment comes without mercy to those who have shown no mercy mercy triumphs over judgment 
what profit is it my brothers if someone says he has faith but he has no works can that faith save him
suppose that a brother or sister is badly clothed and lacks food for the day
suppose that one of you says to them go in peace stay warm and be filled if you do not give them the things necessary for the body what profit is that
in the same way faith by itself if it does not have works is dead 
yet someone may say you have faith and i have works show me your faith without works and i will show you my faith by my works
you believe that there is one god you do well but even the demons believe that and they tremble
do you want to know foolish man that faith without works is useless  some important and ancient greek copies read do you want to know foolish man how it is that faith without works is dead 
was not abraham our father justified by works when he offered up isaac his son on the altar
you see that faith worked with his works and that by works his faith was completed
the scripture was fulfilled that says abraham believed god and it was counted to him as righteousness and he was called a friend of god
you see that it is by works that a man is justified and not only by faith 
in the same way also was not rahab the prostitute justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them away by another road
for as the body apart from the spirit is dead even so faith apart from works is dead  
not many of you should become teachers my brothers for you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly
for we all stumble in many ways if anyone does not stumble in words he is a perfect man able to control even his whole body 
now if we put bits into horses mouths for them to obey us we can also direct their whole bodies
notice also that ships although they are so large and are driven by strong winds are steered by a very small rudder to wherever the pilot desires 
in this way the tongue is a small member yet it boasts great things notice also how small a fire sets on fire a large forest
the tongue is also a fire a world of evil set among our members the tongue defiles the whole body sets on fire the course of life and is itself set on fire by hell 
for every kind of wild animal bird reptile and sea creature is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind
but no human being can tame the tongue it is a restless evil full of deadly poison 
with it we praise the lord and father and with it we curse men who have been made in gods likeness
out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing my brothers these things should not happen 
does a spring pour out from its opening both sweet and bitter water
does a fig tree my brothers make olives or a grapevine figs neither can salty water produce sweet water 
who is wise and understanding among you let that person show a good life by his works in the humility of wisdom
but if you have bitter jealousy and ambition in your heart do not boast and lie against the truth 
this is not the wisdom that comes down from above rather it is earthly unspiritual demonic
for where there are jealousy and ambition there is confusion and every evil practice
but the wisdom from above is first pure then peaceloving gentle reasonable full of mercy and good fruits impartial and sincere
the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace among those who make peace  
where do quarrels and disputes among you come from do they not come from your desires that fight among your members
you desire and you do not have you murder and covet and you are not able to obtain you fight and quarrel you do not possess because you do not ask
you ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly in order that you may use it for your desires 
you adulteresses do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility against god so whoever desires to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of god
or do you think the scripture says in vain the spirit he caused to live in us is deeply envious 
but god gives more grace so the scripture says god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble
so submit to god resist the devil and he will flee from you 
come close to god and he will come close to you cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you doubleminded people
grieve mourn and cry let your laughter turn into mourning and your joy into gloom
humble yourselves before the lord and he will exalt you 
do not speak evil about another brothers the person who speaks evil about a brother or judges his brother speaks evil about the law and judges the law if you judge the law you are not a doer of the law but a judge
only one is the lawgiver and judge he is the one who is able to save and to destroy who are you you who judge your neighbor 
now listen you who say today or tomorrow we will go into this city spend a year there trade and make a profit
who knows what will happen tomorrow and what is your life for you are a mist that appears for a little while and then disappears 
instead you should say if the lord wishes we will live and do this or that
but now you are boasting about your arrogant plans all such boasting is evil
so for anyone who knows to do good but does not do it for him it is sin  
come now you who are rich weep and wail because of the miseries coming on you
your riches have rotted and your clothes have become motheaten
your gold and your silver have become tarnished and their rust will be a witness against you it will consume your flesh like fire you have stored up your treasure for the last days 
look the wages you kept back from the laborers who mowed your fields are crying out against you the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the lord of hosts
you have lived in luxury on the earth and indulged yourselves you have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter
you have condemned and murdered the righteous person he does not oppose you 
be patient then brothers until the lords coming see how the farmer waits for the precious fruit from the ground and he is patient about it until it receives the early and late rains
you too be patient strengthen your hearts because the lords coming is near 
do not complain brothers against one another so that you will not be condemned see the judge is standing at the door
take an example brothers from the suffering and patience of the prophets those who spoke in the name of the lord
see we regard those who endured as blessed you have heard of the endurance of job and you know the purpose of the lord how he is very compassionate and merciful 
above all my brothers do not swear either by heaven or by the earth or by any other oath rather let your yes mean yes and your no mean no so you do not fall under judgment 
is anyone among you suffering hardship let him pray is anyone cheerful let him sing praise
is anyone among you sick let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him let them anoint him with oil in the name of the lord
the prayer of faith will heal the sick person and the lord will raise him up if he has committed sins god will forgive him 
so confess your sins to one another and pray for each other so that you may be healed the prayer of a righteous person is very strong in its working
elijah was a man just like us he prayed earnestly that it would not rain and it did not rain in the land for three years and six months
then elijah prayed again the heavens gave rain and the earth produced its fruit 
my brothers if anyone among you strays from the truth and someone brings him back
that person should know that whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death and will cover over a great number of sins.
peter an apostle of jesus christ to the foreigners of the dispersion the chosen ones throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia
this is according to the foreknowledge of god the father through the sanctifying work of the spirit for obedience and for the sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ may grace be to you and may your peace increase 
may the god and father of our lord jesus christ be praised in his great mercy he has given us new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead
this is for an inheritance that will not perish will not become stained and will not fade away it is reserved in heaven for you
you are protected by gods power through faith for the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time 
in this you greatly rejoice even though now for a little while you may have to suffer all kinds of trials
this is for the proving of your faith which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire this happens so that your faith will be found to result in praise glory and honor at the revealing of jesus christ 
you have not seen him but you love him you do not see him now but you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory
you are now receiving for yourselves the result of your faith the salvation of your souls
concerning this salvation the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to come to you searched diligently and examined carefully 
inquiring into what person or time the spirit of christ in them was indicating when he testified beforehand about the sufferings of christ and the glories that would follow
it was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you when they spoke of the things that have now been told to you by those who preached the gospel to you by the holy spirit sent from heaventhings into which angels long to look 
so gird up the loins of your mind be sober put your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you when jesus christ is revealed
as obedient children do not conform yourselves to the desires that you followed when you were ignorant 
but as the one who called you is holy you too be holy in your whole behavior
for it is written be holy because i am holy
so if you call father the one who judges impartially and according to each persons work conduct yourselves in fear during your time here as foreigners 
you know that it was not with perishable silver or gold that you have been redeemed from the futile behavior that you inherited from your ancestors
but by the precious blood of christ like that of a lamb without blemish or spot 
christ was foreknown before the foundation of the world but now he has been revealed to you in these last times
through him you believe in god who raised him from the dead and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are in god 
you made your souls pure by obedience to the truth this was for the purpose of sincere brotherly love so love one another earnestly from a pure heart  some important and ancient greek copies read you made your souls pure by obedience to the truth through the spirit 
you have been born again not from perishable seed but from imperishable seed through the living and remaining word of god 
for all flesh is like grass  and all its glory is like the wild flower of the grass the grass dries up and the flower falls off 
but the word of the lord remains forever this word is the gospel that was preached to you  
therefore put aside all evil all deceit hypocrisy envy and all slander
as newborn infants long for pure spiritual milk so that through it you may grow in salvation
if you have tasted that the lord is kind 
come to him who is a living stone that has been rejected by people but that has been chosen by god as valuable to him
you also are like living stones that are being built up to be a spiritual house in order to be a holy priesthood that offers the spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ 
scripture contains this see i am laying in zion a cornerstone  chosen and valuable whoever believes in him  will not be ashamed 
the value then is to you who believe but to those who do not believe the stone that was rejected by the builders  this has become the head of the corner
and a stone of stumbling  and a rock that makes them fall they stumble because they disobey the wordwhich is what they were appointed to do 
but you are a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for gods possession so that you would announce the wonderful actions of the one who called you out from darkness into his marvelous light
once you were not a people but now you are the people of god you did not receive mercy but now you have received mercy 
beloved i exhort you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from fleshly desires which fight against your soul
your conduct among the gentiles should be honorable so that when they slander you as evildoers they may be eyewitnesses of your good deeds and give glory to god on the day when he appears 
be subject to every human authority for the lords sake obey both the king as supreme
and also the governors who are sent for the punishment of evildoers and to praise those who do good
for this is gods will that in doing good you silence the ignorant talk of foolish people
as free people do not use your freedom as a covering for wickedness but be like servants of god
honor all people love the brotherhood fear god honor the king 
servants be subject to your masters with all respect be subject not only to the good and gentle masters but also to the malicious ones
for it is praiseworthy if because he is conscious of god a person endures sorrows while suffering unjustly
for how much credit is there if you sin and then endure while being afflicted but if you have done good and then you suffer while being punished this is worthy of praise from god 
for it is to this that you were called because christ also suffered for you he left an example for you to follow in his steps
he committed no sin  neither was any deceit found in his mouth
when he was insulted he gave no insult in return when he suffered he did not threaten back but he gave himself over to the one who judges justly 
he himself carried our sins in his body on the tree so that we would die to sin and live for righteousness by his bruises you have been healed
all of you had been straying like lost sheep but now you have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls  
in the same way you who are wives should submit to your own husbands do this so that even if some men are disobedient to the word they may be won without a word through their wives behavior
having been eyewitnesses of your respectful pure behavior 
do not let your adornment be outwardthe braiding of hair and putting on of gold ornaments or the clothing you wear
instead let your adornment be the inner person of the heart with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which is precious before god 
for this is how holy women long ago who hoped in god adorned themselves by submitting to their husbands
in this way sarah obeyed abraham and called him her lord you are now her children if you do what is good and if you are not afraid of trouble 
in the same way you husbands should live with your wives according to understanding as with a weaker container a woman you should give them honor as fellow heirs of the grace of life do this so that your prayers will not be hindered 
finally all of you be likeminded compassionate loving as brothers tenderhearted and humble
do not pay back evil for evil or insult for insult on the contrary continue to bless because for this you were called that you might inherit a blessing 
the one who wants to love life  and see good days should stop his tongue from evil  and his lips from speaking deceit
let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good  let him seek peace and pursue it
the eyes of the lord see the righteous  and his ears hear their prayers but the face of the lord is against those who do evil 
who is the one who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good
but even if you suffer because of righteousness you are blessed do not fear their threats do not be troubled 
instead set apart the lord christ in your hearts as holy always be ready to give an account to anyone who asks about the hope you have
however with meekness and respect have a good conscience so that in whatever you are spoken of as evil the people who slander your good life in christ may be put to shame
it is better if it should be gods will that you suffer for doing good than for doing evil 
christ also suffered once for sins he who is righteous suffered for us who were unrighteous so that he would bring us to god he was put to death in the flesh but he was made alive by the spirit
by the spirit he went and preached to the spirits who are now in prison
they were disobedient when the patience of god was waiting in the days of noah in the days of the building of an ark and god saved a few peopleeight soulsby means of the water 
this is a symbol of the baptism that saves you nownot as a washing away of dirt from the body but as the appeal of a good conscience to godthrough the resurrection of jesus christ
christ is at the right hand of god he went into heaven angels authorities and powers must submit to him  
therefore because christ suffered in the flesh arm yourselves with the same intention for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin
as a result such a person for the rest of his time in the flesh no longer lives for mens desires but for gods will 
for the time that has passed is enough for you to do the desire of the gentiles living in sensuality lusts drunkenness drunken celebrations having wild parties and committing lawless acts of idolatry
they think it is strange that you do not join with them in these floods of reckless behavior so they speak evil about you
they will give an account to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead
for this purpose the gospel was preached also to the dead so that although they have been judged in the flesh as humans they may live in the spirit the way god does 
the end of all things is coming near therefore be of sound mind and be sober in your thinking for the sake of prayers
above all things have fervent love for one another for love covers a multitude of sins
be hospitable to one another without complaining 
as each one of you has received a gift use it to serve one another as good stewards of gods grace in its various forms
if anyone speaks let it be with gods words if anyone serves let it be from the strength that god supplies do these things so that in all ways god would be glorified through jesus christ may there be to jesus christ glory and dominion forever and ever amen 
beloved do not regard as strange the testing in the fire that has come upon you as if something strange were happening to you
instead however much you experience the sufferings of christ rejoice so that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed
if you are insulted for christs name you are blessed because the spirit of glory and of god rests on you 
but let none of you suffer as a murderer a thief an evildoer or a meddler
yet if anyone suffers as a christian let him not be ashamed instead let him glorify god with that name 
for it is time for judgment to begin with the household of god if it begins with us what will be the outcome for those who disobey gods gospel
and if it is difficult for the righteous to be saved  what will become of the ungodly and the sinner
therefore let those who suffer because of gods will commit their souls to the faithful creator in welldoing  
i am exhorting the elders among youi who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and am also one who will share in the glory that will be revealed
be shepherds of gods flock that is under your care serving as overseersnot because you must but because you are willing as god would have you servenot for shameful profit but eagerly
do not act as lords over those allotted to you instead be examples to the flock
then when the chief shepherd is revealed you will receive an unfading crown of glory 
in the same way you younger men submit to the older men all of you clothe yourselves with humility and serve one another for god is opposed to the proud  but he gives grace to the humble
therefore humble yourselves under gods mighty hand so that he may exalt you in due time
cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you 
be sober be watchful your adversary the devil is walking around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour
stand against him be strong in your faith you know that your brotherhood in the world is enduring the same sufferings 
after you suffer for a little while the god of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in christ will perfect you confirm you strengthen you and establish you
to him be the dominion forever and ever amen 
i regard silvanus as a faithful brother and i have written to you briefly through him i am exhorting you and i am testifying to you that what i have written is the true grace of god stand in it
the woman who is in babylon who is chosen together with you greets you also mark my son greets you
greet one another with a kiss of love. may peace be to you all who are in christ.
simon peter a slave and apostle of jesus christ to those who have received the same precious faith as we have received faith in the righteousness of our god and savior jesus christ
may grace and peace increase in measure in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord 
by his divine power all things for life and godliness have been given to us through the knowledge of him who called us through his own glory and excellence
through these he gave us precious and great promises so that you might be sharers in the divine nature having escaped the corruption in the world that is caused by evil desires 
for this reason do your best to add goodness to your faith and to goodness add knowledge
to knowledge add selfcontrol to selfcontrol add endurance to endurance add godliness
to godliness add brotherly love and to brotherly love add love 
if these things are in you and grow in you they will keep you from being barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ
but whoever lacks these things is so nearsighted that he is blind having forgotten he has been cleansed from his past sins 
therefore brothers do your best to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you will not stumble
in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ 
therefore i will always be ready to remind you of these things although you know them and although you are strong in the truth you now have
i think it is proper for me as long as i am in this tent to stir you up by way of reminder
for i know that the putting off of my tent will be soon because our lord jesus christ has revealed this to me
i will make every effort to see that after my departure you may always be able to remember these things 
for we did not follow cleverly invented myths when we made known to you the power and the coming of our lord jesus christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty
for he received honor and glory from god the father when a voice was brought to him by the majestic glory saying this is my beloved son with him i am well pleased
we ourselves heard this voice brought from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain 
for we have the prophetic word made more certain to which you would do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts
above all you must understand that no prophecy of scripture comes from someones own interpretation
for no prophecy was ever brought by the will of man but men spoke from god when they were carried along by the holy spirit  
false prophets came to the people and false teachers will also come to you they will secretly bring with them destructive heresies and they will deny the master who bought them they are bringing quick destruction upon themselves
many will follow their sensuality and through them the way of truth will be slandered
in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words their condemnation has been coming for a long time and their destruction is not asleep 
for if god did not spare the angels who sinned but delivered them into hell to be kept in chains of darkness until the judgment  some important and ancient greek copies read to be kept in pits of darkness until the judgment 
and if he did not spare the ancient world but preserved noah a herald of righteousness along with seven others when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly
and if he reduced the cities of sodom and gomorrah to ashes and condemned them to destruction as an example of what is to happen to the ungodly 
but delivered righteous lot who was oppressed by the sensual behavior of lawless people
for that righteous man who was living among them day after day was tormented in his righteous soul by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds
if the lord did these things then he knows how to rescue godly men out of trials and how to hold unrighteous men in custody so they can be punished on the day of judgment 
this is especially true for those who walk after the corrupt desires of the flesh and who despise authority bold and selfwilled they do not tremble when they blaspheme the glorious ones
angels have greater strength and power but they do not bring insulting judgments against them to the lord 
but these people are like unreasoning animals born for capture and destruction they do not know what they insult in destruction they also will be destroyed
suffering harm as a reward for doing harm they think that luxury during the day is a pleasure they are stains and blemishes they enjoy their deceitful actions while they are feasting with you  some ancient copies of the greek text read they enjoy their actions while they are feasting with you in love feasts 
they have eyes full of adultery they are never satisfied with sin they entice unstable souls into wrongdoing and they have their hearts trained in greed they are cursed children 
they have abandoned the straight way and have gone astray following the way of balaam son of beor who loved to receive payment for unrighteousness  many modern translations read balaam son of beor in order to be consistent with the old testament spelling of the name some modern translations choose to follow the spelling of the greek text which reads balaam son of bosor 
but he obtained a rebuke for his own transgressiona mute donkey speaking in a human voice stopped the prophets insanity 
these men are springs without water and mists driven by a storm the gloom of thick darkness is reserved for them
they speak with vain arrogance through the lusts of the flesh through sensuality they entice people who are trying to escape from those who live in error
they promise freedom to them but they themselves are slaves of corruption for a man is a slave to whatever overcomes him 
if they have escaped the corruptions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and savior jesus christ and are again entangled in them and overcome the last state has become worse for them than the first
it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to have known it and to turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them
this proverb is true for them a dog returns to its own vomit and a washed pig returns to the mud  
beloved this is now the second letter that i have written to you and in both of them they are reminders to stir up your sincere mind
so that you will recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command of our lord and savior given through your apostles 
know this first that mockers will come in the last days they will mock and proceed according to their own desires
they will say where is the promise of his return from when our fathers fell asleep all things have stayed the same since the beginning of creation 
they deliberately forget that long ago by the word of god the heavens and the earth came to exist out of water and through water
through which the world at that time was destroyed being flooded with water
by the same word the heavens and the earth are reserved for fire being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly people 
it should not escape your notice beloved that one day with the lord is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day
the lord is not slow concerning his promise as some consider slowness to be rather he is patient toward you he does not desire for any of you to perish but for everyone to come to repentance 
however the day of the lord will come as a thief the heavens will pass away with a loud noise the elements will be burned with fire and the earth and the deeds in it will be laid bare  it is uncertain which greek word is intended for the last word of verse  either laid bare or burned up are the choices there is uncertainty about which word should be chosen the second choice would be the elements will be burned with fire and the earth and the deeds in it will be burned up  
since all these things will be destroyed in this way what kind of people should you be you should live holy and godly lives
you should expect and hasten the coming of the day of god on that day the heavens will be destroyed by fire and the elements will be melted in great heat
but according to his promise we are waiting for the new heavens and the new earth where righteousness will dwell 
therefore beloved since you expect these things do your best to be found spotless and blameless before him in peace
also consider the patience of our lord to be salvation just as our beloved brother paul wrote to you according to the wisdom that was given to him
paul speaks of these things in all his letters in which there are things that are difficult to understand ignorant and unstable men distort these things as they also do the other scriptures to their own destruction 
therefore beloved since you know about these things beforehand guard yourselves so that you are not led astray by the deceit of lawless people and lose your own faithfulness
but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ. may the glory be to him both now and to the day of eternity. amen
that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked at and our hands have touched concerning the word of life
the life was made known and we have seen and testify and proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the father and which has been made known to us 
that which we have seen and heard we declare also to you so you also will have fellowship with us our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ
also we are writing these things to you so that our joy will be complete  some important ancient greek copies read and we are writing these things to you so that your joy will be complete  
this is the message that we have heard from him and are proclaiming to you god is light and in him there is no darkness at all
if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we are lying and are not practicing the truth
but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from every sin 
if we say that we have no sin we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us
but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
if we say that we have not sinned we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us  
children i am writing these things to you so that you will not sin but if anyone sins we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the one who is righteous
he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins and not for ours only but also for the whole world
we know that we have come to know him if we keep his commandments 
the one who says i know god but does not keep his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him
but whoever keeps his word in him truly the love of god has been perfected by this we know that we are in him
whoever says that he remains in god should himself also walk just as he walked 
beloved i am not writing a new commandment to you but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning the old commandment is the word that you heard
yet i am writing a new commandment to you which is true in christ and in you because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining 
the one who says that he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness until now
the one who loves his brother remains in the light and there is no occasion for stumbling in him
but the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness he does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes 
i am writing to you children because your sins are forgiven because of his name
i am writing to you fathers because you know the one who is from the beginning i am writing to you young men because you have overcome the evil one i have written to you children because you know the father
i have written to you fathers because you know the one who is from the beginning i have written to you young men because you are strong and the word of god remains in you and you have overcome the evil one 
do not love the world or the things that are in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him
for everything that is in the worldthe lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the arrogance of lifeis not from the father but is from the world
the world and its desire are passing away but whoever does the will of god will remain forever 
children it is the last hour just as you heard that the antichrist is coming now many antichrists have come by this we know that it is the last hour
they went out from us but they were not from us for if they had been from us they would have remained with us but when they went out that showed they were not from us 
but you have an anointing from the holy one and you all know
i did not write to you because you do not know the truth but because you know it and because no lie is from the truth 
who is the liar but the one who denies that jesus is the christ that person is the antichrist since he denies the father and the son
no one who denies the son has the father whoever confesses the son also has the father 
as for you let what you have heard from the beginning remain in you if what you heard from the beginning remains in you you will also remain in the son and in the father
this is the promise he gave to useternal life
i have written these things to you about those who would lead you astray 
as for you the anointing that you received from him remains in you and you do not need anyone to teach you but as his anointing teaches you everything and is true and is not a lie and just as it has taught you remain in him
now children remain in him so that when he appears we will have boldness and not be ashamed before him at his coming
if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone who does what is right has been born from him  
see what kind of love the father has given to us that we should be called children of god and this is what we are for this reason the world does not know us because it did not know him  some important and ancient greek copies leave out and this is what we are 
beloved we are now children of god and it has not yet been revealed what we will be we know that when christ appears we will be like him for we will see him just as he is
everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure 
everyone who sins is committing acts of lawlessness for sin is lawlessness
you know that christ was revealed in order to take away sins and in him there is no sin
no one who remains in him will keep on sinning no one who continues to sin has seen him or known him 
children do not let anyone lead you astray the one who does righteousness is righteous just as christ is righteous
the one who commits sin is from the devil for the devil has sinned from the beginning for this reason the son of god was revealed so that he would destroy the devils works 
whoever has been born from god does not continue to sin because gods seed remains in him he cannot continue to sin because he has been born of god
in this the children of god and children of the devil are revealed whoever does not do what is righteous is not from god neither is the one who does not love his brother 
for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning we should love one another
we should not be like cain who was from the evil one and murdered his brother why did he kill him because his works were evil and his brothers righteous 
do not be amazed my brothers if the world hates you
we know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers anyone who does not love remains in death
anyone who hates his brother is a murderer you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him 
by this we know love because christ laid down his life for us we also ought to lay down our lives for the brothers
but whoever has the worlds goods sees his brother in need and shuts up his heart of compassion from him how does the love of god remain in him
my children let us not love in word or in tongue but in actions and truth 
it is by this we know that we are from the truth and we assure our hearts before him
for if our hearts condemn us god is greater than our hearts and he knows all things
beloved if our hearts do not condemn us we have confidence toward god
whatever we ask we will receive from him because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing before him 
this is his commandment that we should believe in the name of his son jesus christ and love one another just as he gave us this commandment
the one who keeps gods commandments remains in him and god remains in him by this we know that he remains in us by the spirit whom he gave to us  
beloved do not believe every spirit instead test the spirits to see whether they are from god because many false prophets have gone out into the world
by this you will know the spirit of godevery spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is from god
and every spirit that does not confess jesus is not from god this is the spirit of the antichrist which you have heard is coming and now is already in the world  some important and ancient greek copies read and every spirit that does not acknowledge that jesus has come in the flesh is not from god this is the spirit of the antichrist which you have heard is coming and now is already in the world  
you are from god children and have overcome them because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world
they are from the world therefore what they say is from the world and the world listens to them
we are from god anyone who knows god listens to us he who is not from god does not listen to us by this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error 
beloved let us love one another for love is from god and everyone who loves is born from god and knows god
the person who does not love does not know god for god is love 
because of this the love of god was revealed among us that god has sent his only son into the world so that we would live because of him
in this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and that he sent his son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins 
beloved if god so loved us we also should love one another
no one has ever seen god if we love one another god remains in us and his love is perfected in us
by this we know that we remain in him and he in us because he has given us some of his spirit
also we have seen and testify that the father has sent the son to be the savior of the world 
whoever confesses that jesus is the son of god god remains in him and he in god
also we have known and believed the love that god has for us god is love and the one who remains in this love remains in god and god remains in him 
because of this this love has been made perfect among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment because as he is just so are we in this world
there is no fear in love instead perfect love throws out fear because fear has to do with punishment but the one who fears has not been made perfect in love 
we love because god first loved us
if anyone says i love god but hates his brother he is a liar for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love god whom he has not seen
also this is the commandment we have from him whoever loves god must also love his own brother  
whoever believes that jesus is the christ is born from god and whoever loves a father also loves the child born from him
this is how we know that we love the children of god when we love god and obey his commandments
for this is love for god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not burdensome 
for everyone who is born from god overcomes the world and this is the victory that has overcome the world even our faith
who is the one who overcomes the world the one who believes that jesus is the son of god 
this is the one who came by water and blood jesus christ he came not only by water but also by water and blood the spirit is the one who testifies because the spirit is the truth
for there are three that testify
the spirit the water and the blood these three are in agreement  some important and ancient greek copies read for there are three that testify in heaven the father the word and the holy spirit these three are one and there are three that testify on earth the spirit the water and the blood and these three are as one  however the best copies do not have this reading 
if we receive the testimony of men the testimony of god is greater for this is the testimony of god that he has testified concerning his son
anyone who believes in the son of god has the testimony in himself anyone who does not believe god has made him out to be a liar because he has not believed the testimony that god has given concerning his son 
and the testimony is this god gave us eternal life and this life is in his son
the one who has the son has life the one who does not have the son of god does not have life 
i have written to you these things so that you will know that you have eternal lifeto you who believe in the name of the son of god
also this is the confidence we have before him that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us
also if we know that he hears uswhatever we ask of himwe know that we have whatever we have asked of him 
if anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not result in death he must pray and god will give him life i refer to those whose sin does not result in death there is a sin that results in death i am not saying that he should pray about that
all unrighteousness is sin but there is sin that does not result in death 
we know that whoever has been born from god does not sin but the one who was born from god keeps him safe and the evil one cannot harm him
we know that we are from god and we know that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one 
but we know that the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true also we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ this one is the true god and eternal life
children, keep yourselves from idols.
from the elder to the chosen lady and her children whom i love in truthand not only i but also all those who have known the truth
because of the truth that remains in us and will be with us forever
grace mercy and peace will be with us from god the father and from jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love 
i rejoice greatly that i have found some of your children walking in truth just as we have received this commandment from the father
now i plead with you ladynot as though i were writing to you a new commandment but one that we have had from the beginningthat we should love one another
this is love that we should walk according to his commandments this is the commandment just as you heard from the beginning that you should walk in it 
for many deceivers have gone out into the world and they do not confess that jesus christ came in the flesh this is the deceiver and the antichrist
look to yourselves that you do not lose the things for which we have labored but so that you may receive a full reward 
whoever goes on ahead and does not remain in the teaching of christ does not have god the one who remains in the teaching this one has both the father and the son
if anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching do not receive him into your house and do not greet him
for the one who speaks a greeting to him participates in his evil deeds 
i have many things to write to you but i did not wish to write them with paper and ink however i hope to come to you and speak face to face so that our joy will be complete
the children of your chosen sister greet you.
the elder to beloved gaius whom i love in truth
beloved i pray that all may go well with you and that you may be healthy just as it is well with your soul
for i rejoiced greatly when brothers came and bore witness to your truth just as you walk in truth
i have no greater joy than this to hear that my children walk in the truth 
beloved you practice faithfulness whenever you labor for the brothers and for strangers
who have borne witness of your love in the presence of the church you do well to send them off on their journey in a manner worthy of god
because it was for the sake of the name that they went out taking nothing from the gentiles
we therefore should welcome such as these so that we will be fellow workers for the truth 
i wrote something to the congregation but diotrephes who loves to be first among them does not receive us
so if i come i will call attention to the deeds he is doing falsely accusing us with wicked words not satisfied with that he not only refuses to welcome the brothers himself but he also stops those who want to welcome them and drives them out of the church 
beloved do not imitate what is evil but what is good the one who does good is of god the evildoer has not seen god
demetrius received a good testimony from everyone and by the truth itself we also testify about him and you know that our testimony is true 
i had many things to write to you but i do not wish to write them to you with pen and ink
but i hope to see you soon and we will speak face to face
may peace be with you. the friends greet you. greet our friends there by name.
jude a servant of jesus christ and brother of james to those who are called beloved in god the father and kept for jesus christ
may mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you 
beloved while i was making every effort to write to you about our common salvation i had to write to you to exhort you to struggle earnestly for the faith that was entrusted once for all to gods holy people
for certain men have slipped in secretly among you these men were marked out for condemnation they are ungodly men who have changed the grace of our god into sensuality and who deny our only master and lord jesus christ 
now i wish to remind youalthough once you fully knew itthat the lord saved a people out of the land of egypt but that afterward he destroyed those who did not believe
also angels who did not keep to their own position of authority but who left their proper dwelling placegod has kept them in everlasting chains in utter darkness for the judgment on the great day 
so also sodom and gomorrah and the cities around them gave themselves over to sexual immorality and perverse sexual acts they serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire
yet in the same way these dreamers also defile their bodies they reject authority and they slander the glorious ones 
but even michael the archangel when he was arguing with the devil and disputing with him about the body of moses did not dare to bring a slanderous judgment against him but he said may the lord rebuke you
but these people insult whatever they do not understand and what they do understand naturally like unreasoning animals these are the very things that destroy them
woe to them for they have walked in the way of cain and have plunged into balaams error for profit they have perished in korahs rebellion 
these people are dangerous reefs at your love feasts feasting with you fearlesslyshepherds who only feed themselves they are clouds without rain carried along by winds autumn trees without fruittwice dead uprooted
they are violent waves in the sea foaming up their shame wandering stars for whom the gloom of complete darkness has been reserved forever 
enoch the seventh from adam prophesied about them saying look the lord is coming with thousands and thousands of his holy ones
he is coming to execute judgment on everyone he is coming to convict all the ungodly of all the works they have done in an ungodly way and of all the bitter words that ungodly sinners have spoken against him
these are grumblers complainers following their evil desires their mouths speak loud boasts flattering others for profit 
but you beloved remember the words that were spoken in the past by the apostles of our lord jesus christ
they said to you in the last time there will be mockers who will follow their own ungodly desires
it is these who cause divisions they are worldly and they do not have the spirit 
but you beloved build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the holy spirit
keep yourselves in gods love and wait for the mercy of our lord jesus christ that brings you eternal life 
be merciful to those who doubt
save others by snatching them out of the fire to others show mercy with fear hating even the garment defiled by the flesh 
now to the one who is able to keep you from stumbling and to cause you to stand before his glorious presence without blemish and with great joy
to the only god our savior through jesus christ our lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time, now, and forever. amen.
this is the revelation of jesus christ that god gave him to show his servants what must soon take place he made it known by sending his angel to his servant john
who testified about the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ all the things that he saw
blessed is the one who reads aloud this prophecy and those who listen to the words of this prophecy and who obey what is written in it because the time is near 
john to the seven churches in asia may grace be to you and peace from the one who is and who was and who is to come and from the seven spirits who are before his throne
and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth to the one who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood
he has made us a kingdom priests for his god and fatherto him be the glory and the power forever and ever amen 
look he is coming with the clouds  every eye will see him including those who pierced him  all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of him  yes amen
i am the alpha and the omega says the lord god the one who is and who was and who is to come the almighty  some important and ancient greek copies read i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end says the lord god  
i johnyour brother and the one who shares with you in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are in jesuswas on the island called patmos because of the word of god and the testimony about jesus
i was in the spirit on the lords day i heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet
it said write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churchesto ephesus to smyrna to pergamum to thyatira to sardis to philadelphia and to laodicea 
i turned around to see whose voice was speaking to me and as i turned i saw seven golden lampstands
in the middle of the lampstands there was one like a son of man wearing a long robe that reached down to his feet and a golden sash around his chest 
his head and hair were as white as woolas white as snowand his eyes were like a flame of fire
his feet were like polished bronze like bronze that had been refined in a furnace and his voice was like the sound of many rushing waters
he had seven stars in his right hand and a sword with two sharp edges was coming out of his mouth his face was shining like the sun at its strongest 
when i saw him i fell at his feet like a dead man he placed his right hand on me and said do not be afraid i am the first and the last
and the one who lives i was dead but look i live forever and ever and i have the keys of death and of hades 
therefore write down what you have seen what is now and what will take place after this
as for the hidden meaning about the seven stars you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches  
to the angel of the church in ephesus write the words of the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and who walks among the seven golden lampstands
i know your deeds your hard labor and your patient endurance and that you cannot tolerate those who are evil but you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not and you have found them to be false 
you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name and you have not grown weary
but i have against you the fact that you have left behind your first love
remember therefore from where you have fallen repent and do the things you did at first unless you repent i will come to you and i will remove your lampstand from its place 
but you have this you hate the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate
let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit is saying to the churches to the one who conquers i will give the right to eat from the tree of life which is in the paradise of god 
to the angel of the church in smyrna write the words of the one who is the first and the last the one who was dead and who became alive again
i know your sufferings and your poverty but you are rich i know the slander of those who say they are jews but they are not they are a synagogue of satan 
do not fear what you are about to suffer look the devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you will be tested and you will suffer for ten days be faithful until death and i will give you the crown of life
let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit is saying to the churches the one who conquers will not be hurt by the second death 
to the angel of the church in pergamum write the words of the one who has the sword with two sharp edges
i know where you live there where satans throne is yet you hold on tightly to my name i know that you did not deny your faith in me even in the days of antipas my witness my faithful one who was killed among you there where satan lives 
but i have a few things against you you have there some who hold tightly to the teaching of balaam who taught balak to throw a stumbling block before the sons of israel so they would eat food sacrificed to idols and be sexually immoral
in the same way you even have some who hold tightly to the teaching of the nicolaitans 
repent therefore if you do not i will quickly come to you and i will wage war against them with the sword in my mouth
let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit is saying to the churches to the one who conquers i will give some of the hidden manna and i will give a white stone with a new name written on the stone a name which no one knows but the one who receives it 
to the angel of the church in thyatira write these are the words of the son of god who has eyes like a flame of fire and feet like polished bronze
i know your deeds your love and faith and service and your patient endurance i know that what you have done recently is more than you did at first 
but i have this against you you tolerate the woman jezebel who calls herself a prophetess by her teaching she deceives my servants to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols
i gave her time to repent but she is not willing to repent of her immorality 
look i will throw her onto a sickbed and those who commit adultery with her into great suffering unless they repent of her deeds
i will strike her children dead and all the churches will know that i am the one who searches out thoughts and hearts i will give to each one of you according to your deeds 
but to the rest of you in thyatira to everyone who does not hold this teaching and does not know what some call the deep things of satanto you i say i do not put any other burden on you
in any case you must hold on tightly until i come 
the one who conquers and does my works until the end to him i will give authority over the nations
he will rule them with an iron rod like clay jars he will break them into pieces
just as i have received from my father i will also give him the morning star
let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit is saying to the churches  
to the angel of the church in sardis write the words of the one who holds the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know your deeds you have a name that you are alive but you are dead
wake up and strengthen what remains but is about to die because i have not found your deeds complete in the sight of my god 
remember therefore what you have received and heard obey it and repent but if you do not wake up i will come as a thief and you will not know what hour i will come against you
but you have a few names in sardis who have not stained their clothes and they will walk with me dressed in white for they are worthy 
the one who conquers will be clothed in white garments and i will never wipe his name out of the book of life and i will confess his name before my father and before his angels
let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit is saying to the churches 
to the angel of the church in philadelphia write the words of the one who is holy and true  he holds the key of david  he opens and no one shuts  he shuts and no one can open
i know your deeds look i have put before you an open door that no one can shut i know that you have little strength yet you have obeyed my word and have not denied my name 
look i will cause those who belong to the synagogue of satan those calling themselves jews but are not but rather liarsi will make them come and bow down before your feet and they will know that i love you
since you have kept my command to endure patiently i will also keep you from the hour of testing that is coming on the whole world to test those who live on the earth
i am coming soon hold to what you have so no one can take away your crown 
the one who conquers i will make a pillar in the temple of my god never again will he go out of it and i will write on him the name of my god the name of the city of my god the new jerusalem that comes down out of heaven from my god and my new name
let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit is saying to the churches 
to the angel of the church in laodicea write the words of the amen the reliable and true witness the ruler over gods creation
i know your deeds and that you are neither cold nor hot i wish that you were either cold or hot
so because you are lukewarmneither hot nor coldi am about to vomit you out of my mouth 
for you say i am rich i have had many material possessions and i need nothing but you do not know that you are most miserable pitiable poor blind and naked
listen to my advice buy from me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich and brilliant white garments so you may clothe yourself and not show the shame of your nakedness and salve to anoint your eyes so you will see 
i rebuke and discipline everyone whom i love therefore be earnest and repent
look i am standing at the door and am knocking if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come into his home and will eat with him and he with me 
the one who conquers i will give him the right to sit down with me on my throne just as i also conquered and sat down with my father on his throne
let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit is saying to the churches  
after these things i looked and i saw an open door in heaven the first voice that i had heard was speaking to me like a trumpet saying come up here and i will show you what must happen after these things
at once i was in the spirit and i saw there a throne placed in heaven with someone sitting on it
the one who was sitting on it looked like jasper and carnelian there was a rainbow around the throne the rainbow was like an emerald in appearance 
around the throne were twentyfour thrones and seated on the thrones were twentyfour elders dressed with white garments with golden crowns on their heads
from the throne came flashes of lightning rumblings and crashes of thunder seven flaming lamps were burning in front of the throne lamps that were the seven spirits of god 
before the throne was a sea of glass like crystal in the middle of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes front and back 
the first living creature was like a lion the second living creature was like a calf the third living creature had a face like a man and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle
the four living creatures each had six wings full of eyes on top and underneath night and day they do not stop saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty  who was and who is and who is to come 
whenever the living creatures give glory honor and thanks to the one who sits on the throne the one who lives forever and ever
the twentyfour elders fall down before the one seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever they lay their crowns before the throne saying
worthy are you our lord and our god  to receive glory and honor and power for you created all things  and by your will they existed and were created  
then i saw in the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne a scroll written on the front and on the back sealed with seven seals
i saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals 
no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to read it
i wept bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to read it
but one of the elders said to me do not weep look the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has conquered he is able to open the scroll and its seven seals 
i saw a lamb standing in the middle of the throne area and among the four living creatures and among the elders he looked as though he had been killed he had seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent out into all the earth
he went and took hold of the scroll out of the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne 
when he had taken the scroll the four living creatures and the twentyfour elders fell down before the lamb each of them had a harp and a golden bowl full of incense which are the prayers of gods holy people 
they sang a new song you are worthy to take the scroll  and to open its seals for you were slaughtered  and with your blood you purchased people for god  from every tribe language people and nation
you made them a kingdom and priests to serve our god  and they will reign on the earth 
then i looked and heard the sound of many angels who encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders their total number was ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands
they said in a loud voice worthy is the lamb who has been slaughtered  to receive power wealth wisdom strength  honor glory and praise 
i heard every created thing that was in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the seaeverything in themsaying to the one who sits on the throne and to the lamb  be praise honor glory and dominion  forever and ever
the four living creatures said amen and the elders fell down and worshiped  some important and ancient greek copies read the twentyfour elders fell down and worshiped the one who lives forever and ever   
i looked when the lamb opened one of the seven seals and i heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice that sounded like thunder come
i looked and there was a white horse its rider held a bow and he was given a crown he came out as a conqueror in order to conquer 
when the lamb opened the second seal i heard the second living creature say come
then another horse came outfiery red to its rider was given permission to take peace away from the earth so that its people would slaughter one another this rider was given a huge sword 
when the lamb opened the third seal i heard the third living creature say come i saw a black horse and its rider held a pair of scales in his hand
i heard what seemed to be a voice among the four living creatures say a choenix of wheat for one denarius and three choenices of barley for a denarius but do not harm the oil and the wine 
when the lamb opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth living creature say come
then i saw a pale horse the rider on it was named death and hades was following him they were given authority over onefourth of the earth to kill with the sword with famine and disease and with the wild animals of the earth 
when the lamb opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed because of the word of god and the testimony which they held
they cried out with a loud voice how long ruler over all holy and true until you judge those who live on the earth and until you avenge our blood
then each of them was given a white robe and they were told that they should wait a short time longer until the full number of their fellow servants and their brothers who were to be killed just as they had been killed was made complete 
when the lamb opened the sixth seal i watched and there was a great earthquake the sun became as black as sackcloth and the full moon became like blood
the stars in the heavens fell to the earth just as a fig tree drops its unripe figs when shaken by a stormy wind
the sky vanished like a scroll that was being rolled up every mountain and island was moved out of its place 
then the kings of the earth and the important people and the commanders and the rich and the powerful and everyone else slave and free hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains
they said to the mountains and to the rocks fall on us hide us from the face of the one who is seated on the throne and from the lambs wrath
for the great day of their wrath has come who is able to stand  
after this i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth tightly holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind should blow on the earth on the sea or against any tree
i saw another angel coming up from the east who had the seal of the living god he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels who were given permission to harm the earth and the sea
do not harm the earth the sea or the trees until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our god 
i heard the number of those who were sealed  who were sealed from every tribe of the people of israel
twelve thousand from the tribe of judah were sealed twelve thousand from the tribe of reuben twelve thousand from the tribe of gad
twelve thousand from the tribe of asher twelve thousand from the tribe of naphtali twelve thousand from the tribe of manasseh 
twelve thousand from the tribe of simeon twelve thousand from the tribe of levi twelve thousand from the tribe of issachar
twelve thousand from the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand from the tribe of joseph and twelve thousand from the tribe of benjamin were sealed 
after these things i looked and there was a huge multitude that no one could countfrom every nation tribe people and languagestanding before the throne and in front of the lamb they were wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands
and they were crying out with a loud voice salvation belongs to our god  who is seated on the throne  and to the lamb 
all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures and they fell on their faces before the throne they worshiped god
saying amen praise glory wisdom thanksgiving honor power and strength  be to our god forever and ever amen 
then one of the elders asked me who are these clothed with white robes and where did they come from
i said to him sir you know and he said to me these are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb 
for this reason they are before the throne of god  and they worship him day and night in his temple the one who is seated on the throne  will spread his tent over them
they will not be hungry again  nor will they be thirsty again the sun will not beat down on them  nor any burning heat
for the lamb at the center of the throne  will shepherd them and he will guide them to springs of living water  and god will wipe away every tear from their eyes  
when the lamb opened the seventh seal there was a silence in heaven for about half an hour
then i saw the seven angels who stand before god and seven trumpets were given to them 
another angel came holding a golden incense bowl standing at the incense altar much incense was given to him so that he would offer it with the prayers of all gods holy people on the golden incense altar before the throne
the smoke of the incensewith the prayers of gods holy peoplerose up before god from the angels hand
the angel took the incense bowl and filled it with fire from the altar then he threw it down to the earth and there were crashes of thunder rumblings flashes of lightning and an earthquake 
the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them
the first angel sounded his trumpet and there was hail and fire mixed with blood it was thrown down onto the earth so that a third of it was burned up a third of the trees were burned up and all the green grass was burned up  some important and ancient greek copies leave out so that a third of it was burned up  
the second angel sounded his trumpet and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea a third of the sea became blood
a third of the living creatures in the sea died and a third of the ships were destroyed 
the third angel sounded his trumpet and a huge star fell from the sky blazing like a torch on a third of the rivers and springs of water
the name of the star is wormwood a third of the waters became wormwood and many people died from the waters that became bitter 
the fourth angel sounded his trumpet and a third of the sun was struck as well as a third of the moon and a third of the stars so a third of them turned dark a third of the day and a third of the night had no light 
i looked and i heard an eagle  some copies have the word angel instead of eagle  that was flying overhead calling out with a loud voice woe woe woe to those who live on the earth because of the remaining trumpet blasts that are about to be sounded by the three angels  
then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet i saw a star from heaven that had fallen to the earth the star was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit
he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit and smoke went up out of the shaft like smoke from a huge furnace the sun and the air were turned dark by the smoke from the shaft 
out of the smoke locusts came on the earth and they were given power like that of scorpions on the earth
they were told not to damage the grass on the earth or any green plant or tree but only the people who did not have the seal of god on their foreheads 
they were not given permission to kill those people but only to torture them for five months their agony would be like the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a person
in those days people will seek death but will not find it they will greatly desire to die but death will flee from them 
the locusts looked like horses prepared for war on their heads were something like crowns of gold and their faces were like human faces
they had hair like womens hair and their teeth were like lions teeth
they had breastplates like iron breastplates and the sound of their wings was like the sound made by many chariots and horses running into battle 
they had tails with stingers like scorpions in their tails they had power to harm people for five months
they had as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit his name in hebrew was abaddon and in greek he had the name apollyon
the first woe is past look after this there are still two disasters to come 
the sixth angel sounded his trumpet and i heard a voice coming from the horns of the golden altar that is present before god
saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet release the four angels who had been bound at the great euphrates river
the four angels who had been prepared for that hour that day that month and that year were released to kill a third of mankind 
the number of the soldiers on horseback was  i heard their number
this is how i saw the horses in my vision and those who rode on them their breastplates were fiery red dark blue and yellow as sulfur the heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions and out of their mouths came fire smoke and sulfur 
a third of the people were killed by these three plagues the fire smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths
for the power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tailsfor their tails were like snakes having heads with which they inflicted wounds on people 
the rest of mankind those who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands nor did they stop worshiping demons and idols of gold silver bronze stone and woodthings that cannot see hear or walk
neither did they repent of their murders their sorcery their sexual immorality or their acts of theft  
then i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven he was clothed in a cloud and there was a rainbow above his head his face was like the sun and his feet were like pillars of fire
he held a little scroll which was opened in his hand he put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land 
then he shouted in a loud voice like a roaring lion when he shouted the seven thunders spoke out with their sounds
when the seven thunders spoke out i was about to write but i heard a voice from heaven saying seal up what the seven thunders said do not write it down 
then the angel i saw standing on the sea and the earth raised his right hand to heaven
he swore by the one who lives forever and ever who created heaven and all that is in it the earth and all that is on it and the sea and all that is in it and the angel said there will be no more delay
but on the day when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet then the mystery of god will be accomplished just as he proclaimed the good news to his servants the prophets 
the voice i heard from heaven spoke to me again go take the open scroll that is in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land
then i went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll he said to me take the scroll and eat it it will make your stomach bitter but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey 
i took the little scroll from the angels hand and ate it it was as sweet as honey in my mouth but after i ate it my stomach became bitter
then someone said to me you must prophesy again about many peoples nations languages and kings  
a reed was given to me to use like a measuring rod i was told get up and measure the temple of god and the altar and those who worship in it
but do not measure the courtyard outside the temple for it has been given over to the gentiles they will trample the holy city for fortytwo months 
i will give my two witnesses authority to prophesy for  days clothed in sackcloth
these witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that have stood before the lord of the earth
if anyone chooses to harm them fire comes out of their mouth and devours their enemies anyone who wishes to harm them must be killed in this way 
these witnesses have authority to close up the sky so that no rain will fall during the days that they prophesy they have power to turn the waters to blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague whenever they wish
when they will have finished their testimony the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will wage war against them he will conquer them and kill them 
their bodies will lie in the street of the great city which is symbolically called sodom and egypt where their lord was crucified
for three and a half days some from every people tribe language and nation will look at their bodies they will not permit them to be placed in a tomb 
those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate they will even send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who lived on the earth
but after three and a half days a breath of life from god will enter them and they will stand on their feet great fear will fall on those who see them
then they will hear a loud voice from heaven say to them come up here then they will go up into heaven in a cloud while their enemies look on 
at that hour there will be a major earthquake and a tenth part of the city will collapse seven thousand people will be killed in the earthquake and the survivors will be terrified and give glory to the god of heaven
the second woe is past look the third woe is coming quickly 
then the seventh angel sounded his trumpet and loud voices spoke in heaven and said the kingdom of the world has become  the kingdom of our lord and of his christ  and he will reign forever and ever 
then the twentyfour elders who sit on their thrones in the presence of god fell upon their faces and worshiped god
they said we give thanks to you lord god almighty  the one who is and who was because you have taken your great power  and have begun to reign  the best copies of the ancient greek text have the phrase who was and who is but some later copies of the greek add the phrase and who is to come  
the nations were enraged  but your wrath has come the time has come for the dead to be judged  and for you to reward your servants the prophets and gods holy people and those who feared your name  both the unimportant and the mighty the time has come  for you to destroy those who are destroying the earth 
then gods temple in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple there were flashes of lightning rumblings crashes of thunder an earthquake and a great hailstorm  
a great sign was seen in heaven a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head
she was pregnant and she was crying out in birth pains in the anguish of childbirth 
then another sign was seen in heaven look there was a huge red dragon that had seven heads and ten horns and there were seven crowns on his heads
his tail swept away a third of the stars in heaven and hurled them down to the earth the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth so that when she gave birth he would devour her child 
she gave birth to a son a male child who would rule all the nations with an iron rod her child was snatched away to god and to his throne
and the woman fled into the wilderness where god had prepared a place for her so she could be taken care of for  days 
now there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon and his angels fought back
but the dragon was not strong enough to win so there was no longer any place in heaven for him and his angels
the great dragonthat old serpent called the devil or satan who deceives the whole worldwas thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him 
then i heard a loud voice in heaven now have come the salvation and the power  and the kingdom of our god  and the authority of his christ for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down  the one who accused them before our god day and night 
they conquered him  by the blood of the lamb  and by the word of their testimony for they did not love their lives  even to death
therefore rejoice you heavens  and all who reside in them but woe to the earth and to the sea  because the devil has gone down to you he is filled with terrible anger  and knows that he has only a little time 
when the dragon realized he had been thrown down to the earth he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child
but the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle so that she would flee to the place prepared for her in the wilderness this was the place where she would be taken care of for a time times and half a timeout of the serpents presence 
the serpent poured water out of his mouth like a river so that he might make a flood to sweep her away
but the earth helped the woman the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon was pouring out of his mouth
then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war with the rest of her descendants those who obey gods commandments and hold to the testimony about jesus
then the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore  
then i saw a beast coming up out of the sea it had ten horns and seven heads on its horns were ten crowns and on each of its heads was a blasphemous name
this beast i saw was like a leopard its feet were like a bears feet and its mouth was like a lions mouth the dragon gave it his power his throne and his great authority to rule 
one of the beasts heads seemed to have a fatal wound but that fatal wound had been healed the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast
they also worshiped the dragon for he had given his authority to the beast they worshiped the beast too and kept saying who is like the beast and who can fight against it 
the beast was given a mouth that could speak proud words and blasphemies it was permitted to exercise authority for fortytwo months
so the beast opened its mouth to speak blasphemies against god blaspheming his name and his tabernacle those who live in heaven 
the beast was permitted to wage war with gods holy people and to conquer them also authority was given to it over every tribe people language and nation
all who live on the earth will worship it everyone whose name was not written in the book of life which belongs to the lamb who had been slaughtered from the foundation of the world 
if anyone has an ear let him hear
if anyone is to be taken into captivity  into captivity he will go if anyone is to be killed with the sword  with the sword he will be killed here is a call for the patient endurance and faith of gods holy people 
then i saw another beast coming up out of the earth he had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon
he exercised all the authority of the first beast in his presence and he made the earth and those who live on it worship the first beastthe one whose lethal wound had been healed 
he performed mighty miracles he even made fire come down on the earth from heaven in front of people
by the signs he was given power on behalf of the beast he deceived those who live on the earth telling them to set up an image for the beastwho was wounded by the sword but he still lived 
he was permitted to give breath to the beasts image so that the image would even speak and cause all who refused to worship the beast to be killed
he also forced everyone unimportant and mighty rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on the right hand or on the forehead
it was impossible for anyone to buy or sell unless he had the mark of the beast that is the number representing its name 
this calls for wisdom if anyone has insight let him calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a human being his number is   
i looked and saw the lamb standing on mount zion with him were  who had his name and his fathers name written on their foreheads
i heard a voice from heaven sounding like a roar of many waters and loud thunder the sound i heard was also like harpists playing their harps 
they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders no one could learn the song except for the  who had been bought from the earth
these are the ones that have not defiled themselves with women for they have kept themselves sexually pure it is these who follow the lamb wherever he goes these were redeemed from among mankind as firstfruits for god and for the lamb
no lie was found in their mouth they are blameless 
i saw another angel flying in midair who had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earthto every nation tribe language and people
he called out with a loud voice fear god and give him glory for the hour of his judgment has come worship him the one who made the heaven the earth the sea and the springs of water 
another angela second angelfollowed saying fallen fallen is babylon the great who persuaded all the nations to drink the wine of her immoral passion 
another angela third angelfollowed them saying with a loud voice if anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand
he will also drink some of the wine of gods wrath the wine that has been poured undiluted into the cup of his anger the person who drinks it will be tormented with fire and sulfur before gods holy angels and before the lamb 
the smoke from their torment goes up forever and ever and they have no rest day or nightthese worshipers of the beast and his image and everyone who receives the mark of his name
here is a call for the patient endurance of gods holy people those who keep the commandments of god and their faith in jesus 
i heard a voice from heaven say write this blessed are the dead who die in the lord yes says the spirit so that they may rest from their labors for their deeds will follow them 
i looked and there was a white cloud seated on the cloud was one like a son of man he had a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand
then another angel came out of the temple and called with a loud voice to the one sitting on the cloud take your sickle and start to reap for the time to reap has come since the harvest of the earth is ripe
then the one who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth and the earth was reaped 
another angel came out from the temple in heaven he also had a sharp sickle
still another angel came out from the incense altar who had authority over the fire he called out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle take your sharp sickle and gather in the clusters of grapes from the vines of the earth for their grapes are now ripe 
the angel swung his sickle to the earth and harvested the grapevine of the earth he threw it into the great winepress of gods wrath
the winepress was trodden outside the city and blood poured out from it up to the height of a horses bridle for  stadia  
then i saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous there were seven angels with seven plagues which are the final plagues for with them the wrath of god will be completed 
i saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire standing beside the sea were those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and over the number representing his name they were holding harps given to them by god 
they were singing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb great and marvelous are your deeds  lord god the almighty just and true are your ways  king of the nations
who will not fear you lord  and glorify your name for you alone are holy all nations will come  and worship before you  because your righteous deeds have been revealed 
after these things i looked and the temple of the tabernacle of witness was open in heaven
out of the temple came the seven angels holding the seven plagues they were clothed with pure bright linen and had golden sashes around their chests 
one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of god who lives forever and ever
the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power no one could enter it until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed  
i heard a loud voice call out of the temple and say to the seven angels go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of gods wrath 
the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth ugly and painful sores came on the people who had the mark of the beast those who worshiped his image 
the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea it became blood like the blood of a dead person and every living thing in the sea died 
the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water and they became blood
i heard the angel of the waters say you are righteousthe one who is and who was the holy one  because you have judged these things
because they poured out the blood of gods holy people and prophets  you have given them blood to drink  it is what they deserve
i heard the altar reply yes lord god almighty  your judgments are true and righteous 
the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun and it was given permission to scorch the people with fire
they were scorched by the terrible heat and they blasphemed the name of god who has the authority over these plagues they did not repent or give him glory 
then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast and darkness covered its kingdom they chewed on their tongues because of the pain
they blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pain and sores and they still refused to repent of their deeds 
the sixth angel poured out his bowl into the great river the euphrates its water was dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings that would come from the east
i saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouths of the dragon of the beast and of the false prophet
for they are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs they were going out to the kings of the whole world in order to gather them together for the battle on the great day of god almighty 
look i am coming as a thief blessed is the one who keeps watching keeping his garments on so that he does not walk around naked and so that they do not see his shameful condition
they brought them together at the place that is called armageddon in hebrew 
then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air then a loud voice came out of the temple and from the throne saying it is done
there were flashes of lightning rumblings crashes of thunder and a terrible earthquakean earthquake greater than any that has ever happened since human beings have been on the earth so great was this earthquake
the great city was split into three parts and the nations cities collapsed then god called to mind babylon the great and he gave that city the cup filled with the wine made from his furious wrath 
every island disappeared and the mountains were no longer found
great hailstones weighing about a talent came down from the sky upon the people they blasphemed god for the plague of hail because that plague was so terrible  
one of the seven angels who had been holding the seven bowls came and said to me come i will show you the condemnation of the great prostitute who is seated on many waters
with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality and with the wine of her sexual immorality the inhabitants of the earth became drunk 
then the angel carried me away in the spirit to a wilderness and i saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names the beast had seven heads and ten horns
the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet and was adorned with gold precious stones and pearls she was holding in her hand a golden cup full of detestable things and the impurities of her sexual immorality
on her forehead was written a name a mystery babylon the great the mother of prostitutes and of the detestable things of the earth 
i saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of gods holy people and with the blood of the martyrs for jesus when i saw her i was greatly astonished
but the angel said to me why are you astonished i will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that is carrying her the beast that has the seven heads and the ten horns 
the beast you saw existed does not exist now and is about to come up from the bottomless pit then he will go on to destruction those who live on the earth those whose names have not been written in the book of life since the foundation of the worldthey will be astounded when they see the beast because he once was and now is not and yet will come 
this calls for a mind that has wisdom the seven heads are seven hills on which the woman is seated
they are also seven kings five kings have fallen one exists and the other has not yet come and when he comes he must remain for a little while 
the beast that once was and now is not yet he is an eighth king he belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction 
the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom but they will receive authority as kings for one hour together with the beast
these are of one mind and they give over their power and authority to the beast
they will wage war against the lamb but the lamb will conquer them because he is lord of lords and king of kingsand those with him are the called chosen and faithful ones 
the angel said to me the waters you saw where the prostitute is seated are peoples multitudes nations and languages 
the ten horns that you sawthey and the beast will hate the prostitute they will make her desolate and naked they will devour her flesh and they will burn her completely with fire
for god has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give their power to rule to the beast until gods words are fulfilled 
the woman you saw is the great city that has power to rule over the kings of the earth  
after these things i saw another angel coming down out of heaven he had great authority and the earth was illumined by his glory
he cried out with a mighty voice saying fallen fallen is babylon the great  she has become a dwelling place for demons a prison for every unclean spirit  a prison for every unclean bird  a prison for every unclean and detestable animal
for all the nations have drunk  the wine of her immoral passion the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her  the merchants of the earth have become rich from the power of her sensual way of living 
then i heard another voice from heaven say come out from her my people  so that you will not share in her sins  and so that you will not receive any of her plagues
her sins have piled up as high as heaven  and god has remembered her evil actions
pay her back as she has paid others back  and repay her double for her deeds  in the cup she mixed mix double the amount for her 
as she glorified herself and lived in luxury  give her just as much torture and grief for she says in her heart  i am seated as a queen i am not a widow  and i will never see mourning
therefore in one day her plagues will come  death mourning and famine she will be consumed by fire  for the lord god is mighty and he is her judge 
the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality and went out of control with her will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning
they will stand off at a distance afraid of her torment saying woe woe to the great city  babylon the powerful city for in a single hour your punishment has come 
the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her since no one buys their merchandise anymore
merchandise of gold silver precious stone pearls fine linen purple silk scarlet all kinds of scented wood every vessel of ivory every vessel made of most precious wood bronze iron marble
cinnamon spice incense myrrh frankincense wine oil fine flour wheat cattle and sheep horses and chariots and bodies and souls of people 
the fruit that you desired with all your might is gone from you all your luxury and splendor have vanished never to be found again 
the merchants of these goods who became rich by her will stand away from her at a distance because of the fear of her torment weeping and mourning loudly
they will say woe woe to the great city  that was dressed in fine linen in purple and in scarlet  and was adorned with gold precious jewels and pearls
in a single hour all that wealth has been laid waste every ships captain every seafaring man sailors and all who make their living from the sea stood off at a distance 
they cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning they said what city is like the great city
they threw dust on their heads and cried out weeping and mourning woe woe to the great city  where all who had their ships  at sea became rich from her wealth for in a single hour she has been laid waste
rejoice over her heaven  you holy people and apostles and prophets for god has brought your judgment on her 
a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea saying in this way babylon the great city  will be thrown down with violence  and will not be seen anymore
the sound made by harpists musicians  flute players and trumpeters  will not be heard anymore in you no craftsman of any kind  will be found in you no sound of a mill  will be heard anymore in you 
the light of a lamp  will not shine in you anymore the voices of the bridegroom and the bride  will not be heard in you anymore for your merchants were the princes of the earth  and the nations were deceived by your sorcery
in her the blood of prophets and of gods holy people was found  and the blood of all who have been killed on the earth  
after these things i heard what sounded like a loud voice of a large number of people in heaven calling out hallelujah salvation glory and power belong to our god 
his judgments are true and just for he has judged the great prostitute  who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality he has avenged the blood of his servants  from her hand 
they spoke a second time hallelujah the smoke rises from her forever and ever
the twentyfour elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped god who was seated on the throne they were saying amen hallelujah 
then a voice came out from the throne saying praise our god  all you his servants you who fear him  both the unimportant and the powerful 
then i heard what sounded like the voice of a great number of people like the roar of many waters and like mighty crashes of thunder saying hallelujah  for the lord reigns our god the almighty 
let us rejoice and be glad  and give him the glory for the wedding celebration of the lamb has come  and his bride has made herself ready
she was permitted to be dressed  in bright and clean fine linen for fine linen is the righteous acts of gods holy people 
the angel said to me write this blessed are those who are invited to the wedding feast of the lamb he also said to me these are true words of god
i fell down at his feet to worship him but he said to me do not do this i am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold the testimony about jesus worship god for the testimony about jesus is the spirit of prophecy 
then i saw heaven open and i looked and there was a white horse the one riding it is called faithful and true it is with justice that he judges and wages war
his eyes are like a fiery flame and on his head are many crowns he has a name written on him that no one knows but himself
he is clothed with a robe that was dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god 
the armies of heaven were following him on white horses dressed in fine linen white and clean
out of his mouth goes a sharp sword with which he strikes down the nations and he will rule them with an iron rod he tramples in the winepress of the fury of the wrath of god almighty
he has a name written on his robe and on his thigh king of kings and lord of lords 
i saw an angel standing in the sun he called out in a loud voice to all the birds flying overhead come gather together for the great feast of god
come eat the flesh of kings the flesh of commanders the flesh of mighty men the flesh of horses and their riders and the flesh of all men both free and slave the unimportant and the powerful 
i saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies they were assembling in order to wage war with the one who rode the horse and with his army
the beast was captured and with him the false prophet who performed the signs in his presence with these signs he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image the two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur 
the rest of them were killed by the sword that came out of the mouth of the one who rode on the horse all the birds ate their dead flesh  
then i saw an angel coming down from heaven he had the key to the bottomless pit and he had a great chain in his hand
he took hold of the dragon the old serpent which is the devil or satan and bound him for a thousand years
he threw him into the bottomless pit he shut it and sealed it over him this was so that he would not deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were over after that he must be set free for a short amount of time 
then i saw thrones seated on them were those who had been given authority to judge i also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony about jesus and for the word of god they had not worshiped the beast or his image and they had refused to receive the mark on their forehead or hand they came to life and they reigned with christ for a thousand years 
the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended this is the first resurrection
blessed and holy is anyone who takes part in the first resurrection over these the second death has no power they will be priests of god and of christ and will reign with him for a thousand years 
when the thousand years come to an end satan will be released from his prison
he will go out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earthgog and magogto bring them together for the battle they will be as many as the sand of the sea 
they went up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of gods holy peoplethe beloved city but fire came down from heaven and devoured them
the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown they will be tormented day and night forever and ever 
then i saw a great white throne and the one who is seated on it the earth and the heavens fled away from his presence but there was no place for them to go
i saw the deadthe mighty and the unimportantstanding before the throne and the books were opened then another book was openedthe book of life the dead were judged by what was recorded in the books according to their deeds 
the sea gave up the dead who were in it death and hades gave up the dead who were in them and the dead were judged according to their deeds
death and hades were thrown into the lake of fire this is the second deaththe lake of fire
if anyones name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire  
then i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more
i saw the holy city new jerusalem that came down out of heaven from god prepared like a bride adorned for her husband 
i heard a great voice from the throne saying look the dwelling place of god is with human beings and he will live with them they will be his people and god himself will be with them and he will be their god
he will wipe away every tear from their eyes and there will be no more death or grieving or crying or pain the former things have passed away 
the one who was seated on the throne said look i make all things new he said write this down because these words are trustworthy and true
he said to me these things are done i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end to the one who thirsts i will give drink without cost from the spring of the water of life 
the one who conquers will inherit these things and i will be his god and he will be my son
but as for the cowards the faithless the detestable the murderers the sexually immoral sorcerers idolaters and all liars their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur that is the second death 
one of the seven angels came to me the one who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues and he said come here i will show you the bride the wife of the lamb
then he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god 
jerusalem had the glory of god and its brightness was like a very precious jewel like a stone of crystalclear jasper
it had a great high wall with twelve gates with twelve angels at the gates on the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of israel
on the east were three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gates 
the wall of the city had twelve foundations and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
the one who spoke with me had a measuring rod made of gold to measure the city its gates and its wall 
the city was laid out in a square its length was the same as its width he measured the city with the measuring rod twelve thousand stadia in length its length width and height were the same
he also measured its wall  cubits thick by human measurement which is also the angels measure 
the wall was built of jasper and the city of pure gold like clear glass
the foundations of the wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone the first was jasper the second was sapphire the third was agate the fourth was emerald
the fifth was onyx the sixth was carnelian the seventh was chrysolite the eighth was beryl the ninth was topaz the tenth was chrysoprase the eleventh was jacinth and the twelfth was amethyst 
the twelve gates were twelve pearls each of the gates was made from a single pearl the streets of the city were pure gold like transparent glass
i saw no temple in the city for the lord god almighty and the lamb are its temple 
the city had no need of the sun or the moon in order to shine on it because the glory of god shone on it and its lamp is the lamb
the nations will walk by the light of that city the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it
its gates will not be shut during the day and there will be no night there 
they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it
but nothing unclean will ever enter into it nor anyone who does what is detestable or deceitful but only those whose names are written in the lambs book of life  
then the angel showed me the river of the water of life clear as crystal it was flowing from the throne of god and of the lamb
through the middle of the citys street on each side of the river was the tree of life bearing twelve kinds of fruits and it bears its fruit every month the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations 
there will no longer be any curse the throne of god and of the lamb will be in the city and his servants will serve him
they will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads
there will be no more night they will have no need for the light of a lamp or sunlight because the lord god will shine on them they will reign forever and ever 
the angel said to me these words are trustworthy and true the lord the god of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show his servants what must happen soon
look i am coming soon blessed is the one who obeys the words of the prophecy of this book 
i john am the one who heard and saw these things when i heard and saw them i fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things
he said to me do not do that i am a fellow servant with you with your brothers the prophets and with those who obey the words of this book worship god 
then he said to me do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book for the time is near
the one who is unrighteous let him continue to do unrighteousness the one who is morally filthy let him continue to be morally filthy the one who is righteous let him continue to do what is righteous the one who is holy let him continue to be holy 
look i am coming soon my reward is with me to pay back each one according to his deeds
i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last the beginning and the end 
blessed are those who wash their robes so that they will have the right to eat from the tree of life and to enter the city through the gates  instead of blessed are those who wash their robes some ancient copies of the greek text read blessed are those who do his commandments 
outside are the dogs the sorcerers the sexually immoral the murderers the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood 
i jesus have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches i am the root and the descendant of david the bright morning star 
the spirit and the bride say come let the one who hears say come whoever is thirsty let him come and whoever desires it let him freely have the water of life 
i testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds to them god will add to him the plagues that are written about in this book
if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy god will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city that are written about in this book  some older copies read god will take away his share in the book of life and in the holy city that are written about in this book  
the one who testifies to these things says yes i am coming soon amen come lord jesus
the grace of the lord jesus be with all. amen.  some ancient copies of the greek text or ancient translations of the greek text add the phrase be with you holy people or be with all you holy people or be with all of his holy people .
